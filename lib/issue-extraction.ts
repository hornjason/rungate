/**
 * Reading a goal and its acceptance criteria out of an issue body (#210, #202).
 *
 * `scripts/precompute-goal.ts` replaces two ceremony agents with two regexes
 * run over the raw markdown of a GitHub issue. Both were wrong in the same
 * way, and the shared cause is worth stating before either case:
 *
 *   **The extractor had no model of the document it was reading.** It matched
 *   lines. A line inside a fenced code block, a line under a "Scope" heading,
 *   and a line the harness itself wrote into the issue are all just lines.
 *
 * Two measured instances:
 *
 *  - **#210.** Shipping #209, the criteria list came back as exactly one AC:
 *    ``SC-N: `workflows/ship.js` executes [MARKER-NAME]``. That is an
 *    illustration inside a fenced block showing the SYNTAX of a proposed SC.
 *    Marcus was about to be briefed with one acceptance criterion made
 *    entirely of placeholders, and nothing downstream would have asked.
 *  - **#202.** When a run rescopes an issue for the 6-AC limit it PREPENDS a
 *    blockquote banner, which then becomes the first paragraph and therefore
 *    the goal. Measured on #200: 414 characters describing the split, none
 *    describing the defect. The harness degraded its own input, and only on
 *    the LARGE issues where the goal statement matters most.
 *
 * ## Why this is a module and not twenty lines in the script
 *
 * It was twenty lines in the script, at module top level, so none of it was
 * reachable from a test — which is why both defects were found by reading
 * pipeline output by hand rather than by the suite. The functions here take a
 * string and return a value; every case below is a fixture.
 *
 * ## The direction these are allowed to be wrong in
 *
 * Toward extracting LESS and saying so. A criterion missed costs Discovery
 * writing one, which is the designed path. A criterion invented out of
 * documentation is briefed to an agent as a thing to build.

 * banner is written by an agent told to use this wording, so a change to the
 * instruction and no change here turns the suite red instead of silently
 * handing the banner back as a goal (#202).
 *
 * A leading blockquote carrying NONE of these is kept. That is the positive
