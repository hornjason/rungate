/**
 * config-trackable.ts — the harness's own config must not be a file git
 * considers disposable (#505)
 *
 * ## The report
 *
 * A consumer's `.gitignore` ignored `.claude/` wholesale. Its
 * `.claude/rungate.json` had been force-added on one feature branch and was
 * untracked on `main`, so creating a branch off `main` **deleted the file
 * from the working tree** — correctly, from git's point of view: tracked on
 * the branch you leave, ignored on the branch you arrive at. No warning, no
 * prompt, and nothing in `git status` afterwards to say anything had
 * happened. `git clean -x` does the same thing from the other direction.
 *
 * What is lost is not recoverable from defaults: the `pages` map, the
 * consumer list, `remoteHosts`, the `compliance.organize` block. The harness
 * then resolves `absent` and reports "this project has no rungate config",
 * which reads as an unscaffolded project rather than as a checkout artifact.
 *
 * ## Why this is the scaffold's problem and not the consumer's
 *
 * The objection on the issue — that a harness version-controlling its
 * consumers' files on their behalf is worse than the bug — has the boundary
 * in the wrong place. `createGitignore` in `lib/scaffold/steps.ts` already
 * appends `requiredGitignorePatterns()` to an adopting project's
 * `.gitignore` and reports `UPDATED: .gitignore (added N missing entries)`.
 * The scaffold is already an author of that file. The question is only
 * whether, having told a project what to ignore, it may also stop its own
 * config from being one of those things.
 *
 * This makes the config **trackable**. It does not track it: no `git add`,
 * no commit, nothing staged. That remains the consumer's.
 *
 * ## The negation the issue recommends does not work, measured
 *
 * The issue recommends `!.claude/rungate.json` in preference to un-ignoring
 * `.claude/` wholesale, so that `settings.local.json` and `worktrees/` stay
 * ignored. The intent is right and the pattern is inert:
 *
 * ```
 * # .gitignore
 * .claude/
 * !.claude/rungate.json
 * ```
 * ```
 * $ git check-ignore --no-index -q .claude/rungate.json ; echo $?
 * 0
 * $ git add .claude/rungate.json
 * The following paths are ignored by one of your .gitignore files:
 * .claude
 * hint: Use -f if you really want to add them.
 * ```
 *
 * `gitignore(5)`: *"It is not possible to re-include a file if a parent
 * directory of that file is excluded."* git does not descend into an
 * excluded directory, so nothing inside one can be negated. A consumer
 * following that recommendation gets a refusal from `git add` and concludes
 * the harness is wrong.
 *
 * The form that works re-includes the directory and then re-excludes its
 * contents, which keeps everything the issue wanted kept:
 *
 * ```
 * !.claude/
 * .claude/*
 * !.claude/rungate/
 * !.claude/rungate.json
 * ```
 * ```
 * trackable    .claude/rungate.json
 * trackable    .claude/rungate/config.json
 * IGNORED      .claude/settings.local.json
 * IGNORED      .claude/worktrees/x
 * ```
 *
 * ## It asks git rather than reading the file
 *
 * Ignore rules compose from `.gitignore` at every level, `.git/info/exclude`,
 * `core.excludesFile` and the skip-worktree bits. A regex over one
 * `.gitignore` is a detector narrower than what it detects
 * (`.claude/rules/checks-must-be-able-to-fail.md`, second shape), and it
 * would be wrong in the direction that matters: reporting "not ignored" for
 * a config a global excludes file is deleting.
 *
 * `--no-index` is load-bearing for the opposite reason it is in
 * `lib/tracked-vs-ignored.ts`. Without it, `check-ignore` SKIPS paths that
 * are in the index — so on the reported consumer, where the file was
 * force-added on one branch, it would have answered "not ignored" about the
 * exact file that was about to be deleted. The question here is what the
 * RULES say, not what the index currently holds.
 *
 * ## It verifies its own edit, and reverts if it did not work
 *
 * Appending patterns and reporting success is a check that cannot fail: the
 * ignore rule might not be `.claude/`-shaped at all — a `*.json` at the root
 * or a `core.excludesFile` entry needs a different negation, and this block
 * would not help. So the paths are re-measured afterwards, and if they are
 * still ignored the file is restored byte-for-byte and the action says so
 * rather than claiming an `UPDATED:`.
 *
 * The second re-measure is the one that is easy to forget. `.claude/*` is a
 * no-op when `.claude/` was already excluded, and NOT a no-op if the config
 * was ignored by some broader rule — it would newly ignore every other
 * direct child, and any of those that are tracked become the
 * tracked-and-ignored contradiction `lib/tracked-vs-ignored.ts` exists to
 * report. So the set of tracked paths this project's rules match is
 * measured before and after, and a single new entry reverts the write.
