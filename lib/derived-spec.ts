/**
 * Whether a spec file's bytes are authored by a person or produced by a
 * generator — and therefore whether any rungate write path may touch them
 * (#1286).
 *
 * On 2026-10-22 `bunx rungate audit-specs --fix` injected 39 lines of
 * `<!-- REVIEW: unmatched (...) -->` into a consumer's `specs/POV-SPEC.md`.
 * That file is produced by the consumer's own `scripts/sync-spec.ts` and
 * hash-pinned by its `test/spec-drift.test.ts`, so the edit broke the
 * recorded `body-sha256` and reddened their suite — and the next
 * `sync-spec.ts` run would have discarded it regardless. The write was
 * simultaneously destructive and futile.
 *
 * The file said so, in English, on line 12: `<!-- DERIVED FILE — do not edit
 * here.` `--fix` edited it on line 355. **A consumer who does the right thing
 * and labels a derived file got nothing for it**, because the label had no
 * reader. That is the gap this module closes.
 *
 * ## Why a frontmatter key and not the English sentence
 *
 * Matching the prose is the cheapest wrong fix, and it is wrong in the
 * direction nobody sees. The sentence has no spelling: `DERIVED FILE`,
 * `Managed by X — do not edit`, `DO NOT EDIT`, the same words reflowed across
 * a line break, the same words in another language. You cannot enumerate it,
 * and every widening of the pattern buys a false positive — at which point
 * `--fix` silently stops working on a spec somebody wrote by hand, which is
 * the same class of silent failure in the other direction.
 *
 * rungate's own tree already holds both traps:
 *
 *   - `specs/bootstrap-data-flow/consumer-requirements.md` carries
 *     `# Managed by rungate — do not edit.` **twice, inside fenced code
 *     blocks**, quoting generated CI as an illustration.
 *   - `specs/SPEC-TEMPLATE.md` carries `<!-- BEGIN GENERATED PATTERNS -->`,
 *     which delimits a *region* and says nothing about the file.
 *
 * A loose `do not edit` grep stops fixing both of those and reports nothing.
 *
 * ## Why not `generated-sha`, which already exists
 *
 * Because it means the opposite thing. `generated-sha` is **rungate's own**
 * provenance stamp, and `decideRuleWrite` (`lib/rule-provenance.ts`) reads a
 * stamp matching the body as permission to **overwrite** — `action: "update"`,
 * *"harness-written and untouched since"*. Reusing that key here would make
 * one key authorise a write in the rules path and forbid one in the spec
 * path.
 *
 * The fact being declared is different: **a generator that is not rungate
 * owns these bytes.** Foreign ownership, not harness provenance. So it gets
 * its own key, and the key's value names the generator, because a refusal
 * that cannot say where to make the edit instead is a refusal nobody can act
 * on.
 *
 * ## The three readings
 *
 * | reading | `mayWrite` | because |
 * |---|---|---|
 * | `derived` | no | `generated-by:` is declared; permanent and unambiguous |
 * | `unprotected` | no | only a prose marker; caught, but by a detector that is deliberately too narrow to rely on |
 * | `authored` | yes | nothing claims a generator owns it |
 *
 * `unprotected` is the honest middle. The prose detector below is scoped hard
 * — an HTML comment, in the document head, outside code fences — precisely so
 * it cannot eat the two authored specs named above. A detector that narrow
 * **will** miss some real derived file, so a file it does catch is reported
 * as UNPROTECTED and told to declare the key: we held the write this time,
 * and that is not a guarantee you should build on.
 *
 * Refusing is the safe direction either way. A derived file wrongly preserved
 * costs a line in a report. A derived file wrongly written costs the
 * consumer's suite, and the edit is thrown away at the next regeneration.
 *
 * ## One relative import, and the mutant trees carry it
 *
 * `test/derived-spec-guard.test.ts` and `test/spec-write-chokepoint.test.ts`
 * build a mutant copy of this file in an `mkdtemp` directory and run the real
 * write path against it. A relative import the copier did not carry would
 * make that mutant die on module resolution, and a mutant that failed to load
 * is indistinguishable from a guard that held —
 * `.claude/rules/checks-must-be-able-to-fail.md`. So the one import here,
 * `./markdown-fence` (#2135), is copied into both trees, and the guard test
 * asserts it is the only one.
