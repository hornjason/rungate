/**
 * The next free SC number.
 *
 * `SC-<n>` is a GLOBAL id — `lib/sc-ids.ts` says so, and
 * `test/spec-sc-ids-unique.test.ts` enforces it. This function read ONE
 * spec's content, which in a global namespace is not an allocator but a
 * collision generator, and it generated ten (#392): GATE-CONTRACTS-SPEC.md
 * counted up to 378 in its own file and took 379..388 for its per-gate
 * subsections, while CONFIG-DRIVEN-TESTING-SPEC.md independently counted up
 * to 378 in ITS own file and took 379 next. Both were locally correct and
 * neither could see the other.
 *
 * Pass the registry and the whole namespace is consulted, headings included —
 * a number owned by a `### SC-N:` section is just as taken as a tracked one.
 *
 * `reg` is optional so the one-argument answer is unchanged for any caller
 * that has no registry to hand; silently changing that would be a different
 * bug. It is the wrong answer in a shared namespace, which is why
 * `scripts/create-sc.ts` passes one.
 *
 * ## The namespace has a second half, and #392 only fixed the first
 *
 * Consulting the registry stopped two specs minting the same number. It did
 * nothing about test fixtures, which spell SC ids inside the SAME namespace
 * and appear in no registry: `test/sync-sc-status.test.ts:61` is literally
 * `- [ ] SC-9441: AGENTS.md exists`, a checkbox declaration in a string
 * literal. Allocating 900 would mint a criterion out of a scratch number and
 * hand a live claim to a fixture — the shape #392 closed, arriving from the
 * side nothing looks at.
 *
 * So `spelledInSource` is the other half — and only there is the reserved
 * range ignored. The 9000s exist to be safe for fixtures, so counting a
 * FIXTURE at 9450 as taken would push every future criterion past 9000 and
 * destroy the reservation it was built on. That is the one case where a
 * higher number is the wrong answer.
 *
 * A SPEC declaration is authoritative at any number, reserved or not. If a
 * spec has already claimed 9150 then 9150 is claimed, whatever the
 * convention says it should have been, and allocating it again is the
 * collision this function exists to prevent. The reservation is enforced
 * against specs by SC-1524, not by making the allocator pretend.
 */

 * The ids a spec's own text spells, as one binding.
 *
 * The allocator counts them and the reading reports how many it counted; two

 * reading of something else.
 *
 * #2067: a fixture-range id the spec only MENTIONS is left out, exactly as it
 * is for source above. One sentence citing `SC-9999` used to send the next
 * criterion to `SC-10000`. A fixture-range id the spec DECLARES, as a checkbox

/**
 * The next free SC number for a project, over every namespace this machine
 * can see (#503).
 *
 * `nextSCNumber` answers the question for the arguments it is handed, and
 * three widths of that question have each been wrong in turn: one spec's
 * content (#392), the spec registry without test fixtures (#399), and the
 * registry of whichever working tree the command ran in (#503). This is the
 * composition, in one place, so a caller cannot assemble two of the three and
 * believe it asked.
 *
 * It returns the reading alongside the number because the number is a FLOOR:
 * a clone on another machine is outside anything this process can reach, and
 * a caller that printed only the number would be claiming a guarantee the
 * reading explicitly does not give.
 *
 * ## `reg` is REQUIRED, and was optional for two issues (#593)
 *
 * Omit it and `nextSCNumber` skips `reg.declaredById` entirely: the answer is
 * assembled from the spec's own content, source-spelled fixtures and the
 * cross-tree namespace, and the spec registry — the width #392 was filed
 * over — is not consulted at all. The number comes back looking exactly like
 * one that had asked everything, which is the composition failure the
 * paragraph above says this function exists to make impossible. A caller
 * with no registry to hand has `buildScRegistry([])`, which states "this
 * tree declares nothing" instead of defaulting to it.
 *
 * The two readings agree whenever every spec-declared id is also spelled in
 * a source file, which is most of the time and is why nothing noticed. They
 * diverged the day a spec declared eight criteria no test mentioned yet.
 *
 * ## The reading names every leg, not just the cross-tree ones
 *
 * `readScNamespace` accounts for the worktrees and refs it read. The other
 * three widths were invisible in the returned reading, so a CLI could print
 * the number and a complete-looking account of where it came from while one
 * of the legs behind it had never run. They are appended as sources of their
 * own, with the count each contributed — `0` from a leg that was consulted
 * and `0` from a leg that was skipped are the same number and opposite
 * facts (`.claude/rules/config-access.md`).
 *
 * ## …and for two issues all three said `read` without asking (#606)
 *
 * The sentence above was the docstring of a function that hardcoded
 * `status: "read"` on every one of the three. Measured on a tree holding one
 * spec and none of the four source directories: `source-mentions` reported
 * `read, found 0` — which is also the output for a tree whose four
 * directories were walked and held no ids. A consumer whose tests live in
 * `tests/` or `src/` was in the second case on every single run.
 *
 * Two of the three are now derived, and one is not:
 *
 * | Leg | Source of `found` | Can it have failed to read? |
 * |---|---|---|
 * | `spec-content` | `idsInSpecContent(specContent)` | **No.** `specContent` is a string parameter, already in memory. `0` here is a reading |
 * | `registry` | `reg.declaredById.size` | Yes — `reg` may have been built from a `specs/` the caller could not enumerate, which `ScRegistry.enumeration` now states |
 * | `source-mentions` | the source walk | Yes — four directories, any of which the walk returns silently from |
 *
 * `spec-content` stays `read` deliberately. Rewriting all three uniformly is
 * the cheap-looking repair and it adds an unreachable branch to the one leg
 * that was right, which no case can go red over.
 *
 * A leg that could not be fully read also appends to `namespace.unmeasured`,
 * because `status` is a per-leg fact and `unmeasured` is the list a caller
 * prints. A gap in only one of them is a gap a reader can miss.
 *
 * ## …and all six legs read ids that have already been WRITTEN (#725)
 *
 * Every width above answers "which ids can this machine find typed somewhere
 * right now". None of them can see an id another session has decided to take
 * and not yet typed, which is the window `.claude/rules/parallel-sessions.md`
 * says people sit in for an hour. Four collisions on 2026-10-19 came out of
 * it, and in three of them the allocator was never run at all — a renumber
 * during a repair, two individually-correct branch allocations, and ids
 * hand-written into a test file.
 *
 * `lib/sc-reservations.ts` is the seventh leg and the only one that is a
 * reading of a DECLARATION rather than of the tree. `opts.owner` — a branch
 * name or issue ref — selects the caller's own block:
 *
 * | The caller | What it gets |
 * |---|---|
 * | owns a block with room in it | the lowest free id INSIDE that block |
 * | owns a block that is spent | a refusal naming the block |
 * | owns no block | an id above every block in the store, so it cannot land in someone else's |
 *
 * The no-owner row is the one that makes the store work for the renumber
 * case: a session that never declared anything still cannot be handed an id
 * out of a block somebody else declared.
 *
 * A store that is present and could not be read is a REFUSAL, not an empty
 * reading — see `lib/sc-reservations.ts`. A store that is genuinely absent is
 * a skipped leg with a named `unmeasured` entry, because every scaffolded
 * consumer project is in that state and a refusal they cannot act on is a
 * gate everyone learns to click past.
