/**
 * Every call site in this tree that can put bytes on disk, and which of them
 * aim at a spec (#1552).
 *
 * ## What this replaces
 *
 * #1286's completeness sweep classified *files*: a file that reads and writes
 * the same identifier had to appear on one of two declared lists. That check
 * fails when a known writer is unclassified and **cannot** fail when somebody
 * adds a new unguarded one, because list membership is not reachability. It is
 * also blind below the file — a second unguarded write site inside an
 * already-classified file is invisible to it (#1548).
 *
 * This sweep's unit is the **call site**, and its reading is the write's
 * **target expression**, so both of those holes close at once. The question it
 * answers is not "has somebody classified this file" but "does a raw write
 * primitive aim at a spec path without going through `lib/write-spec.ts`".
 *
 * ## The detector's view, stated so it can be argued with
 *
 * For each call to a write primitive, the sweep reads the **written argument
 * expression** and resolves the identifiers in it against the real scope
 * chain. A site is spec-targeting when the resolved text matches `SPEC_TARGET`.
 *
 * The resolution lives in `lib/spec-write-ast.ts` and goes through `acorn` via
 * `lib/ts-ast.ts`. It replaces a hand-rolled lexer whose `initialiserOf` was a
 * file-global name scan (#1566): four AI-review rounds on #1557 found four
 * separate edge cases in that lexer and a fifth was found by its own negative
 * control. The question it was answering — "which binding does this identifier
 * resolve to" — is scope and position, and no name scan answers it.
 *
 * Two deliberate properties:
 *
 *   - **It over-reports.** `spec-compliance-auto.test.ts` is a test, not a
 *     spec, and it matches. An over-report costs one classified line in
 *     `NOT_A_SPEC_PATH`; an under-report is how three unguarded writers
 *     reached review across #1286 and #1549.
 *   - **It names what it cannot resolve.** A parameter, an import and a
 *     destructured binding carry no readable value, and each is reported as
 *     UNRESOLVED rather than resolving to something plausible. A site whose
 *     target shows no string literal AND has an unresolved identifier is
 *     `opaque`: the path is entirely invisible, so the sweep cannot claim it is
 *     not a spec.
 *
 * ## Which directories are in scope, decided rather than inherited
 *
 * The TypeScript half sweeps five directories — `lib scripts gates bin hooks`.
 * `workflows/` and `.github/` are ALSO swept, for `.js`, and that is a
 * deliberate inclusion rather than the default:
 *
 *   - MEASURED 2026-10-24, `grep -rnE '(writeFileSync|writeFile|appendFileSync|
 *     appendFile|renameSync|copyFileSync|truncateSync|Bun\.write)\s*\(' workflows
 *     .github` → **2** call sites, **0** of them naming a spec or an ADR. So
 *     including them changes no reading today.
 *   - They are included anyway because **`workflows/*.js` cannot import**
 *     (#69). That makes them the one region where the chokepoint is not
 *     merely skipped but *unavailable*, so a future spec write there would be
 *     unguarded with no local remedy — it would have to call the CLI. A
 *     region a guard cannot reach is exactly the region worth watching.
 *
 * ## Shell is covered, and the population is zero
 *
 * `shellSpecWrites` scans `.github/workflows/*.yml`, `workflows/`, and `*.sh`
 * for a redirect, a `tee`, or a `sed -i` whose target names `specs/`. Measured
 * 2026-10-24: zero. A TypeScript-only chokepoint is therefore sufficient
 * *today*, which is a fact about the tree and not a property of the design —
 * so the shell reading is taken rather than assumed, and it has its own
 * planted-violation case.

/**
 * Everything that can put bytes on disk, including the non-`fs` spellings.
 *
 * Derived from `SIMPLE_PRIMITIVES` rather than restated, so there is ONE list
 * to extend. A second copy here would drift from the one the detector reads
 * and the sweep would go green on a primitive it no longer looks for.
 *
 * ## This list is irreducible, and it fails toward UNDER-reporting
 *
 * #1566 replaced the sweep's resolution logic with a semantic invariant — a
 * value set is complete only for a `const` with an initialiser, which is a
 * guarantee the *language* makes — so no enumeration of assignment spellings
 * can fall behind there. The obvious next question, raised by the AI review
 * on #1569 (`bbaefb99`), is why this list is not given the same treatment.
 *
 * Because there is nothing to derive it from. Nothing in the language, the
 * type system or the AST distinguishes `writeFileSync` from `readFileSync`;
 * the knowledge lives in Node's documentation. A derivation like
 * `/write|append|rename|copy|truncate/` over callee names would be a detector
 * over spellings, which is the exact trade #1566 removed one layer down —
 * and it would both miss a primitive named otherwise and flag
 * `logger.writeLine`.
 *
 * So the bound stands, and the useful thing to know is its direction:
 *
 *  - **A missed primitive is invisible, not wrong.** The sweep reports
 *    nothing at that call site rather than reporting it incorrectly, so the
 *    chokepoint's green reading silently excludes it. That is the costly
 *    direction, and it is why `Bun.write` is here — somebody hit it.
 *  - **A fix, if one is wanted, is a different instrument.** A capability
 *    check over the `fs` module surface belongs in
 *    `lib/fs-write-capabilities.ts`, not in a cleverer predicate here.
 *
 * Adding a spelling to `SIMPLE_PRIMITIVES` is therefore an ordinary and
 * expected edit. Reaching for a pattern instead is the regression.

 *
 * That is what stops the detector being defeated by an assignment spelling

 * Six entries on this tree, out of 131 write sites — unchanged when the

 * 4), because no parameter, catch or destructured binding here is reassigned.
 * The flag propagates through the expansion, so a locally-`const` target lands
 * here when an identifier INSIDE it is not complete — `backupDir`, `outDir`
 * and `SF` are why most of these are listed.

 * This is the PROSE tier and it deliberately does not cover the wider class
 * of targets that are `opaque` for some other reason. That class is now 96 of

 * ratchets the whole 96 against `OPAQUE_RATCHET` in both directions, so the
 * wider class moves only when somebody writes down that it moved. Six sites
 * make the stronger claim and stay here, with what they write.
