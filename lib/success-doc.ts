 *
 * > **SUCCESS.md is the measure** — it states what we are building and the
 * > falsifiable claims that mean it works. Before filing an issue, reviewing

 *
 * No generator, no template, no step produced it. rungate's own was
 * hand-written once in `22aa5b20` and nothing reproduced that for anyone
 * else, while `specs/HARNESS-STANDARD.md` carried SC-822 asserting a
 * property of a file the scaffold never created. A consumer scaffolded a
 * project, read the generated `AGENTS.md`, and never learned the file was
 * supposed to exist.
 *
 * ## Why a validator and not just a generator
 *
 * A generator alone makes it worse. **An unfilled template is
 * indistinguishable from a considered one to everything except a reader** —
 * that is the same argument `.claude/rules/checks-must-be-able-to-fail.md`
 * makes about guards, applied to a document. A project that ran
 * `create-success` and stopped would now have a `SUCCESS.md` that every
 * "does it exist" check waves through, and five TODO claims read as
 * deliberate at a glance.
 *
 * So the template ships placeholders that are obviously placeholders, marked
 * with a token no prose would contain, and `successViolations` refuses while
 * any survive. **The generator must not invent claims**: five plausible
 * generated claims would be worse than none, because they read as considered
 * and are not.
 *
 * ## Absent is UNMEASURED, not FAIL
 *
 * A project that never opted in has not failed at anything, but it has not
 * succeeded either, and `SKIP` is indistinguishable from success — see
 * `.claude/rules/config-access.md`. So an absent file produces a loud
 * UNMEASURED and a present-but-unfilled one produces a refusal.

 * Lines the project still shares, verbatim, with the template it came from.
 *
 * ## Why the placeholder markers were not enough
 *
 * The first version of this check rested entirely on `PLACEHOLDER_MARKER`,
 * and a security review found the hole by reading what the generator PRINTS:
 * `create-success` tells the user "Replace every line marked
 * `rungate:placeholder`". A user who does exactly that — deletes the five
 * marker lines, names the claims, writes a `How it fails` for each, and stops
 * — produced **seven surviving `TODO`s and zero violations**. `## The thing`
 * was still the template's instruction text, every `**How to measure it:**`
 * still read `TODO`, and `owner:`/`updated:` were still `TODO-OWNER` and
 * `TODO-DATE`.
 *
 * One `grep -v` cleared the entire guard. That is the second shape in
 * `.claude/rules/checks-must-be-able-to-fail.md` — a detector narrower than
 * what it detects — and the narrowing was *instructed by our own output*.
 *
 * ## Why this shape rather than more rules
 *
 * Adding a rule per section (require a filled `## The thing`, require a
 * `**How to measure it:**`, ...) would be a list that has to stay in sync
 * with the template by hand, and a new template section would silently go
 * unchecked. This asks the question directly instead: **is this document
 * still, in part, the template?** It needs no per-section knowledge.
 *
 * **What it does NOT cover, stated because the first version of this
 * sentence claimed otherwise.** It said "a new template section is covered
 * the day it ships", and sec-485 showed that is false: anything the
 * template writes as a table row, a non-claim heading, or a structurally
 * pure line is invisible to this check permanently. The guarantee is
 * narrower — *template PROSE, and claim statements, are covered the day
 * they ship*. A future template that puts its placeholder text into table
 * cells is not covered, and whoever writes one has to think about it.
 *
 * Two of the exclusions were narrowed in response rather than merely
 * documented: claim headings now compare their statement (see below), and
 * the old flat `length <= 12` floor became a test for structural purity,
 * because a short sentence is still a sentence. The floor was hiding
 * `"prevent."` on today's own template.
 *
 * Structural lines are excluded because they are SUPPOSED to match: headings,
 * table rows, frontmatter keys, and anything too short to be instruction
 * prose. Measured against the one real instance — rungate's own SUCCESS.md,
 * written four months before the template — the only overlap is
 * `doc-type: reference` and `status: active`, both frontmatter.

/**
 * Template prose as REFLOW-INVARIANT units: whole sentences, read out of the
 * template with its line breaks collapsed (#515).
 *
 * `templateResidue` compared line against line, so it saw a copy-pasted
 * paragraph only while the line breaks were byte-identical. `prettier
 * --prose-wrap`, a different editor width, or one pass of an LLM rewriting
 * the file moved them without touching a word, and the whole paragraph went
 * invisible. That is the second shape in
 * `.claude/rules/checks-must-be-able-to-fail.md` — *text matching that a
 * reformat, a line break or a different platform defeats* — and the
 * docstring above claimed a guarantee it did not have.
 *
 * ## Why the unit is a sentence and not a block
 *
 * #515 proposed comparing normalized BLOCKS. Measured against the shipped
 * template, that catches strictly less than the line check it would have
 * replaced, and it fails the verbatim case it was meant to keep:
 *
 * - The template writes `<!-- rungate:placeholder -->` on the line directly
 *   above the prose it marks, with no blank line between, so the block IS
 *   the comment plus the prose. A reader who deletes the comment — which
 *   that comment instructs them to do — no longer matches the block. That
 *   is the likeliest real shape, and block comparison misses it.
 * - A reader who keeps one sentence of a four-sentence paragraph no longer
 *   matches the block either, where the line check matched the lines kept.
 *
 * Splitting to sentences fixes both: the unit stops depending on where the
 * newlines are AND on how much of the paragraph survived. It also drops the
 * residual false-refusal surface #515 names — a single wrapped word like
 * `prevent.` is never a sentence, so it stops being a comparable unit at
 * all, where as a LINE it was one.
 *
 * `stripHtmlComments` is applied to BOTH sides, and the battery is the
 * reason it is still here rather than the argument above. Making it a
 * no-op was 0 red of 62 on the first pass: every comment the template
 * carries sits above a `TODO` placeholder that `unfilled()` discards
 * anyway, so no fixture could tell the two apart. The input that can is a
 * reader keeping a template sentence and splitting it with a comment —
 * `test/success-doc.test.ts`'s "an HTML comment interleaved into the prose"
 * case — which is the reformat-defeats-the-detector shape one layer down.
 *
 * Two things measured and NOT changed, recorded so the next reader does not
 * have to measure them again:
 *
 * - **The TEMPLATE-side strip is dead on today's template.** Dropping it is
 *   0 red; dropping the DOCUMENT-side one is 1. An input that distinguishes
 *   them exists — template comment text quoted inside a fenced block in a
 *   document — but it is contrived, and a fixture built to make a number
 *   move is worth less than the sentence saying so. Kept for symmetry, with
 *   the asymmetry written down rather than implied.
 * - **`unfilled()`'s 10-character floor was chosen for an EQUALITY test and
 *   is reused for a SUBSTRING test.** That is sound today — the shortest
 *   live template unit is 22 characters and the shortest non-placeholder
 *   one is 45, and 52,333 external markdown files produce zero new
 *   refusals. A future template sentence of 10-20 characters becomes a
 *   substring landmine against every document in a consumer repo, and the
 *   argument below reasons only about the 4-character `TODO`.
 *
 * `unfilled()` is the floor rather than a fresh number. It is already the
 * module's answer to "is this string too slight to mean anything", and the
 * only template unit it removes is the bare `TODO` a claim heading reduces
 * to — four characters, which as a substring test would match almost every
 * document in this repo.

  // sec-485 demonstrated the consequence on a plausible next-version
  // template: a document whose two claims still read "the system behaves as
  // intended under normal use" scored ZERO violations, because that text
  // lives in a heading. So the prefix is stripped and the STATEMENT is
  // compared.
  //
  // The prefix is matched by SHAPE — a word-run, a number, a separator —
  // rather than by the literal word `Claim` and the literal em-dash today's
  // template happens to use. sec-500 measured the narrow version against
  // four spellings of one statement: `Claim 1 —` and `Claim 1 -` were
  // caught, `Claim 1:` and `SC 1 —` were INVISIBLE, because a heading that
  // misses the pattern falls back to being excluded as structural. That is
  // sec-485's finding surviving for every spelling but one, and a colon is
  // not an exotic choice, so keying the check to a template detail would
  // have reopened the hole on the next template edit.
  //
  // The cost, named because it is real: this cannot tell `Claim 1 — <a
  // statement the reader must write>` from `Phase 2 - <a section title the
  // reader must keep>`, so a template carrying the second gets a false
  // refusal. Zero instances today — the shipped template has no numbered
  // heading but its claims, and the widening flags nothing new across all
  // 227 markdown files in this repo — and `test/success-doc.test.ts`'s
  // "R1 cost" case fails loudly for whoever adds the first one.
