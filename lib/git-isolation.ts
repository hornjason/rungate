/**
 * The git-config isolation set, declared ONCE as data (#1001).
 *
 * ## Why this file exists rather than a second copy of a string
 *
 * `git` executes code out of its own configuration. `core.fsmonitor` is a
 * command git runs, `core.hooksPath` points at hooks git fires, and
 * `core.excludesFile` can make a file invisible to the reading that is
 * supposed to see it. So **running `git` in a directory someone else chose
 * means running whatever that directory's `.git/config` says**, and
 * converting a shell string to an argv does nothing about it.
 *
 * That was measured once, under #960/#965, in a scratch repository with one
 * planted untracked file (git 2.50.1):
 *
 * | poisoned key | written where | unisolated | isolated |
 * |---|---|---|---|
 * | `core.excludesFile` → a file listing the plant | `~/.gitconfig` | **plant INVISIBLE** | `?? planted.txt` |
 * | `core.excludesFile` → a file listing the plant | the checkout's `.git/config` | **plant INVISIBLE** | `?? planted.txt` |
 * | `core.fsmonitor` → a script touching a marker | `~/.gitconfig` | **marker written — git ran it** | not run |
 * | `core.hooksPath` → a dir with `post-index-change` | `~/.gitconfig` | **hook fired** | not fired |
 *
 * **The lesson was learned once and propagated nowhere.** It lived as a
 * single shell-prefix string inside `lib/scaffold/ai-review-step.ts`, so
 * `hooks/CommitEnforcement.hook.ts` — which runs `git -C <a path out of an
 * agent's reply text>` — could not reuse it even in principle: its call sites
 * are `execFileSync('git', […])` and a shell prefix is not an argv.
 *
 * One declaration, two projections. `gitIsolatedShellPrefix()` reproduces the
 * existing string exactly, so `AI_REVIEW_GIT_ISOLATED` is now derived rather
 * than spelled; `gitIsolatedArgs`/`gitIsolatedEnv` serve the `execFileSync`
 * callers. A second declaration of either is refused by
 * `test/git-isolation.test.ts`.
 *
 * ## Why env vars AND `-c`, which is not belt-and-braces
 *
 * `GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL`/`GIT_CONFIG_SYSTEM`/`GIT_CONFIG_NOSYSTEM` neutralise
 * whole FILES, so they cover keys nobody thought to enumerate — but they do
 * not touch the checkout's own `.git/config`, which is inside the tree being
 * read. The `-c` flags are the only thing covering row two of the table, and
 * command scope outranks local scope. **Neither covers the other.**
 *
 * ## `safe.directory='*'` is load-bearing, not a loosening
 *
 * `actions/checkout` writes `safe.directory` for the workspace into the
 * GLOBAL config on every job. Neutralise the global file and that exception
 * goes with it, so wherever the working tree is owned by a different uid than
 * the process — containers, rootless self-hosted pools — `git` exits 128 with
 * *"detected dubious ownership"*. `safe.directory` is honoured only from
 * protected scopes (system, global, command), so `-c` restores it from the
 * one source the subject cannot write, and the checkout's `.git/config` still
 * cannot set it. Without it, isolation would be stricter than what it
 * replaces in a way that fails closed on **green** repositories.
 *
 * ## WHAT THIS DOES NOT COVER
 *
 * - **Config a caller passes deliberately.** These are defaults a caller
 *   prepends; anything added after them wins.
 * - **`git` subcommands that reach the network.** `fetch` with these env vars
 *   also discards a proxy, a CA bundle, or an `insteadOf` rewrite a
 *   self-hosted runner legitimately keeps in `~/.gitconfig`. That is a
 *   different trade-off and is why `buildRestoreScript` was left out of #960.
 * - **The repository's CONTENT.** Isolating config is not reviewing a tree.
 *
 * Issue: #1001. Refs #960, #965.

 * The environment for a git command that must reach a REMOTE.
 *
 * `gitIsolatedEnv` is right for reads: nulling the global and system config
 * makes a reading the same on every machine. It is wrong for `push` and
 * `ls-remote`, because `credential.helper` is declared in exactly those
 * files and removing them removes the credential.
 *
 * Measured 2026-10-31 on this machine, and it is every push rather than a
 * corner case: the only `credential.helper` is `osxkeychain`, declared in
 * the SYSTEM gitconfig at
 * `/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/share/git-core/gitconfig`. Under
 * isolation `git push --dry-run` fails with *"could not read Username for
 * 'https://github.com'"*; run with this env it reports *"Everything
 * up-to-date"*.
 *
 * So this deliberately applies NO env isolation. Command-scope isolation
 * still applies through `gitIsolatedArgs`, which is where the determinism
 * that does not depend on credentials lives. It exists here, beside its
 * opposite, so a caller choosing between them is choosing between two named
 * things in the declaring position rather than hand-rolling an env object.
 *
 * `base` is copied rather than passed through, because a Bun child spawned
 * with no `env` key does not observe a late edit to `process.env` — which
 * would make this branch unreachable from any test that sets one.
