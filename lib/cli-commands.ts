/**
 * What `rungate <command>` dispatches to (#363).
 *
 * Data, not a switch in the bin, because three separate things have to agree
 * and only one of them is code:
 *
 *   1. `bin/rungate.ts` can run the command
 *   2. `package.json`'s `files` ships the script it runs
 *   3. the AGENTS.md generator publishes the command to every consumer
 *
 * Before this existed they did not agree, and the disagreement was invisible
 * from every direction. `AGENTS.md` published `bunx rungate create-spec`;
 * `package.json` declared no `bin`, so the command could not run at all; and
 * `scripts/create-spec.ts` was not in `files`, so even a correct `bin` would
 * have shipped a dispatcher pointing at a script the consumer never received.
 * Three defects, each hiding behind the next.
 *
 * An agent reading `AGENTS.md` ran the command and it failed. An agent
 * reading `package.json` saw no `bin`, concluded rungate had no CLI and was
 * not distributable, and recommended hand-scaffolding a project. Both
 * readings of the repo were wrong, which is the state a single source fixes.
 *
 * ## A command script is run as an ENTRY MODULE, not imported
 *
 * This section used to read: "None of them guards on `import.meta.main`
 * … Adding an `import.meta.main` guard to any of them would silently turn its
 * subcommand into a no-op, so `test/cli-contract.test.ts` runs every command
 * for real." The hazard was named exactly. Both mitigations were false.
 *
 * Three scripts acquired the guard — and `import.meta.main` is FALSE for a
 * dynamically imported module, so `await import(script)` loaded them, ran
 * nothing, and exited 0. Measured on `3da782dc`, dispatcher against the same
 * script run directly, in bytes of output:
 *
 *   audit-specs          0  vs  2092     silent
 *   sync-spec-tests      0  vs  1254     silent
 *   extract-constraints  0  vs    57     silent
 *   ai-review-findings 270  vs   270     reached — see below
 *
 * Three of ten commands reported success having done nothing. The second
 * mitigation is why nobody saw it: `test/cli-contract.test.ts` ran ONE
 * command for real, `create-sc --list`, and its comment names this defect in
 * as many words. One member of the population was enough to hold the
 * assertion up while the other nine went unmeasured — the battery varied the
 * dispatcher and held the COMMAND fixed, and the defect was on that axis
 * (`.claude/rules/checks-must-be-able-to-fail.md`, seventh shape).
 *
 * `scripts/ai-review-findings.ts` is the one that still worked, and it is the
 * prior art rather than the exception: #675 hit this, documented the
 * mechanism in its docblock, and worked around it by calling `main`
 * unconditionally from a wrapper. That fixed one command and left the
 * dispatcher as it was.
 *
 * So the fix is here, in the one place that decides how a command is invoked,
 * rather than three more wrappers — a per-script workaround is three more
 * places to forget, and the forgetting reads as the command succeeding.
 * `runCommandScript` spawns the script with the running bun binary, which
 * makes it the entry module and `import.meta.main` true, exactly as
 * `bun scripts/audit-specs.ts` already was. A guard is now the normal thing
 * for a script to have, instead of a trap.
