/**
 * The ONE place this module runs `git` (#1097).
 *
 * ## Why isolation matters more here than anywhere it has been applied yet
 *
 * Every other consumer of `lib/git-isolation.ts` reads. This one deletes.
 * The chain is three steps and it was live on `origin/main`:
 *
 *   1. `core.excludesFile` makes an untracked file invisible to
 *      `git status --porcelain`. Measured on git 2.50.1 by #1048/#1090.
 *   2. The dirty check below reads clean, so the worktree falls through
 *      every remaining check.
 *   3. `git worktree remove --force` takes the tree, and the file that
 *      existed in exactly one place is gone.
 *
 * **The guard meant to spare the work is the reading that was tampered
 * with**, which is why no amount of care in the checks downstream of it
 * helps. #1090 isolated the census — the module that REPORTS the same
 * reading — and did not touch this one.
 *
 * Latent rather than active when this shipped: none of
 * `core.excludesFile`, `core.hooksPath` or `core.fsmonitor` was set in any
 * scope on the machine (measured 2026-10-22). What makes it worth fixing
 * is that a global gitignore is ordinary advice, setting one silently arms
 * this, and the failure is silent — the summary prints `N removed` and
 * nothing says what was in them.
 *
 * ## One seam, not the flags at each site
 *
 * There are eight `git` invocations in this module. `lib/git-isolation.ts`
 * is the single declaring position for WHAT isolation is; this is the
 * single declaring position for WHERE this module applies it. Pasting the
 * `-c` flags at eight call sites is the cheaper change and is measured as
 * the cheapest WRONG fix in #1090's battery: it works, and it reinstates
 * the drifting spellings #1001 removed.
 *
 * ## WHAT THIS DOES NOT COVER
 *
 * `rmSync` on an orphaned checkout, in the `removeOrphans` arm below. Git
 * has no registration for that directory — that is the definition of the
 * bucket — so there is no git invocation there to isolate and no config
 * that could steer it. It is a recursive delete of content nothing has
 * classified, which is why it is off by default; that is #436's argument
 * and this change does not touch it.
 */
/**
 * The ONE place this module reaches git (#1097).
 *
 * `reach` picks which environment lib/git-isolation.ts hands back, and that
 * is the only thing a caller may vary. A `"remote"` call keeps command-scope
 * isolation and drops the env half, because `credential.helper` lives in the
 * global and system config that the env half nulls — see `gitCredentialEnv`.
 *
 * A second `spawnSync` here would be a second door that can drift, which is
 * what #1097 is about and what `test/worktree-cleanup-isolation.test.ts`
 * refuses. Adding a mode is therefore an edit to this signature, never a new

/**
 * Why a clean, unlocked worktree must be kept, or null to remove it (#431).
 *
 * ## Why "unmerged" stopped being a reason on its own
 *
 * 149 worktrees had accumulated here, 71 of them clean and unmerged, the
 * oldest 13.7 days old, and the cleanup removed none of them for weeks. The
 * rule was "never remove an unmerged branch", which reads as prudence and is
 * actually the wrong question: **`git worktree remove` deletes a checkout,
 * not a branch.** The ref survives, its commits survive, and `git checkout`
 * brings it all back. Nothing is lost.
 *
 * What CAN be lost is work that exists in exactly one place: uncommitted
 * changes — checked before this is called — and commits that never reached
 * origin. So the real safety property is "is every commit on this branch
 * also somewhere else", and asking it directly both protects more (an
 * unpushed branch merged into a local-only main was removable before) and
 * permits more (an unmerged fan-out branch fully pushed is just a stale
 * directory).
 *
 * `merged` is still load-bearing in exactly one case: a repo with no
 * `origin` at all, where "also somewhere else" has no meaning and the only
 * remaining evidence is that main contains the work. Without that arm this
 * change would delete unmerged local-only work, which is the regression that
 * gets a safety check reverted — and `unpushedCommitCount` returns `0` for a
 * remote-less repo, so it would have looked exactly like a pushed branch.

 * the precise inverse of the function's purpose.
 *
