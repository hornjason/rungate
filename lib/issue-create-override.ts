/**
 * Whether a `gh issue create` may run during VERIFY, and why not (#365).
 *
 * `hooks/VerifyPhaseLock.hook.ts` asked the question in eight lines:
 *
 *     if (cmd.includes('--label') && cmd.includes('follow-up')) process.exit(0);
 *
 * That is not a test that a label argument equals `follow-up`. It is a test
 * that the string `follow-up` appears SOMEWHERE in the command, so
 *
 *     gh issue create --label bug --title "Fix the follow-up handler"
 *
 * bypasses the lock entirely while applying no override label at all. A
 * detector whose input is the whole command string cannot tell an argument
 * from a word in a title — shape two of
 * `.claude/rules/checks-must-be-able-to-fail.md`, pointed outward: the guard
 * is wider than the thing it guards.
 *
 * The same shape hid a second bypass one line down. `cmd.includes('gh issue
 * comment')` is unreachable for a plain comment, because the create check
 * above it has already exited — but it IS reachable for
 * `gh issue comment … && gh issue create …`, where the comment clause
 * exempts the create clause.
 *
 * ## The second defect is about the tracker, not the hook
 *
 * `follow-up` means "follow-up work from a shipped issue", and it was the
 * only override, so anything filed during VERIFY had to claim an origin it
 * did not have. On 2026-10-13 an external audit of two consumer projects
 * surfaced three consumer-blocking defects here; #362, #363 and #364 all
 * wear `follow-up` and not one of them is follow-up work from a shipped
 * issue. An agent filtering that label to find loose ends from recent ships
 * gets three unrelated results. `external-audit` exists for exactly that
 * origin and is accepted here.
 *
 * ## What this is, and what it is not
 *
 * Stated because two rounds of commit security review walked the parser
 * inward and a third would too. **This is workflow discipline over `gh`
 * invocations reaching PreToolUse on Bash. It is not a sandbox.** It exists
 * to catch a reflex — an agent mid-VERIFY reaching for `gh issue create`
 * when `verifyBlockers[]` is the right place — and a reflex is defeated by
 * saying no to the command shapes someone actually types.
 *
 * So the parser is held to ordinary shapes: operators with or without
 * surrounding whitespace, newlines, subshells, command substitution
 * including backticks, a path-qualified binary, quoted arguments, trailing
 * `#` comments, backslash line continuations, and `-c` / `-lc` / `eval`
 * wrappers. **Every one of those was a measured bypass of an earlier version
 * of this file**, and each has a row in `test/verify-phase-lock.test.ts`.
 *
 * Out of scope ON PURPOSE, and not a gap to file:
 *
 * - `curl` against the REST API, or the GitHub MCP tools — neither is Bash,
 *   so the hook never sees them.
 * - `ssh host "gh issue create …"` — that runs on another machine against
 *   whatever repo it is configured for, and descending into every remote
 *   command mentioning `gh` buys false refusals, not safety.
 * - Variable indirection — `GH=gh; $GH issue create`. Resolving it means
 *   tracking assignments across clauses, which is the shell interpreter this
 *   file is explicitly not, and nobody reaches for `$GH` by reflex.
 * - A caller who writes a script and runs it.
 * - A `cd` in an earlier clause, which retargets the tracker invisibly.
 *   Resolving it needs directory state across clauses, same reason as above.
 *
 * Each of those takes a decision to get around the lock, and an agent that
 * has made that decision is a problem no matcher fixes. Chasing them trades
 * false refusals — which teach people to work around a guard — for
 * protection against someone already doing so.
 *
 * **Here-strings and here-documents left this list in #1302, and the entry is
 * kept here rather than deleted because the reason it gave was wrong.** It
 * read "a deliberate construction, not a reflex" — an argument about how
 * often a shape is typed, which is not a property of the input and cannot be
 * measured. What settled it was that the body of a heredoc had to be parsed
 * either way: `clauses` was reading the bodies that go into FILES, which is
 * the one case that is certainly not a command, and refusing real work for
 * it. Once `stripHeredocs` removes those, `interpreterPrograms` has to put
 * the executable ones back, and that binding returns herestrings in the same
 * list. So the scope widened as a consequence of fixing a false refusal, and
 * narrowing it again would mean writing a second decider that disagrees with
 * `lib/bash-write-guard.ts`. See `heredocView` below.
