/**
 * Every settings scope, read before anything is concluded about one hook
 * (#713, #910).
 *
 * A LEAF module whose only relative dependency is `hook-trees`, so there is
 * one thing to mutate and one extractor deciding what a command is.
 *
 * ## The defect this exists to make unavailable
 *
 * Twice in three weeks, a census counted the hooks in ONE settings scope,
 * found zero, and reported that as absence.
 *
 * - #713 read `~/.claude/settings.json` and reported `AgentBriefGuard` "dead
 *   in both trees — wired nowhere". It is registered in the repo's PROJECT
 *   settings as `bun ${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/hooks/AgentBriefGuard.hook.ts`.
 * - #910 read this repository's own registries and reported
 *   `TestSuiteRelease.hook.ts` and `ProjectStateSync.hook.ts` "in NO registry"
 *   and never able to fire. Both are registered in `~/.claude/settings.json`
 *   and have been throughout — measured 2026-10-21, parsed rather than
 *   grepped.
 *
 * Same error, opposite scope. `lib/hook-trees.ts` records the first one in its
 * own header and says *"Read EVERY settings scope before concluding anything
 * about one hook"*, and a census that read one shipped anyway. A sentence in a
 * docblock is not a rule (`.claude/rules/config-access.md`).
 *
 * ## Why this is a refusal and not a wider reader
 *
 * The repair that suggests itself is to read more scopes. That is
 * `.claude/rules/checks-must-be-able-to-fail.md`'s fifth shape waiting to
 * happen: it fixes the two instances and leaves the next narrow reading free
 * to report confident absence again, because nothing says a reading has to be
 * complete before a verdict comes out of it.
 *
 * So `hookRegistration` THROWS unless it is handed a reading for every scope
 * in `REGISTRATION_SCOPES`, and an unreadable scope must carry a reason. A
 * caller that opened one file gets a refusal, not an answer.
 *
 * ## The asymmetry, which is the correctness argument
 *
 * A POSITIVE is conclusive from a single scope: a command naming the hook is
 * a registration, whatever the other four say. A NEGATIVE is conclusive from
 * no number of scopes short of all of them. So:
 *
 * | reading | verdict |
 * |---|---|
 * | named by at least one scope | `registered` |
 * | named by none, every scope read | `unregistered` |
 * | named by none, some scope unreadable | `unmeasured` |
 *
 * `unmeasured` is the state CI is in — `~/.claude/settings.json` is machine
 * state and no runner has one — and it is reported rather than skipped,
 * because `0`, `{}`, `null`, `SKIP` and a skipped test are indistinguishable
 * from success and a reading is not.

 * Hook files that nothing the repo owns has placed — the CI-enforceable half.

 * `hookRegistration` answers "is it registered", and on a runner that answer
 * is `unmeasured` for every machine-scoped hook, so a guard built on it is
 * fail-open there. Measured on the first draft of #910 with one input — a
 * hook file registered in no scope at all — run twice, differing only in
 * `HOME`: red where every scope is readable, **green in the CI
 * configuration**. Absence must never read as clean.
 *
 * So this asks a question a runner CAN answer. Not "is it registered", which
 * is machine state, but **"does anything the repo owns say where this hook
 * lives?"** Two ways to say so, and a hook may take either:
 *
 *   1. a repo-owned scope NAMES it — `.claude/settings.json`, its `.local`
 *      sibling, or `.claude/rungate/hooks.json`, whose entry carries both the
 *      command and the `scope` the repo claims for it; or
 *   2. its own header declares why it is registered nowhere.
 *
 * A hook taking neither is one about which the repository has no opinion at
 * all, and that is the state `ProjectStateSync` and `TestSuiteRelease` were
 * in when a census declared them unregistered.
 *
 * **There is deliberately no third way through a registry `scope: "user"`
 * declaration.** A draft had one, and it was a second decider: an entry
 * declaring the scope also carries the command that names the hook, so
 * clause 1 catches every input the extra clause did. Measured — removing it
 * was 1 red, and the one red was its own fixture, with nothing in the live
 * tree able to tell the two versions apart (battery row N7).
 *
 * **Every reading handed here must be readable.** A repo-owned scope is
 * committed, so an unreadable one is a broken checkout rather than an
 * absence, and returning an empty list for it would reinstate the fail-open
 * this function exists to close.
