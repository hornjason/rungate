/**
 * A closing keyword GitHub will never act on (#1362).
 *
 * `.claude/rules/ship-workflow.md` says to put `Fixes #<N>` in the PR body and
 * let the merge close the issue. What it cannot say, because nothing in the
 * tree measured it until now, is that **a closing keyword inside a code span
 * is inert**. GitHub parses the body as markdown and does not link a reference
 * it finds inside backticks or a fenced block, so the PR merges, the author
 * sees the sentence they wrote, and the issue stays open.
 *
 * Measured on `hornjason/pai-harness` at 2026-10-23T15:31Z: of **50** open
 * issues, **27** carry at least one merged pull request cross-reference, from
 * **65** distinct merged pull requests. Running this detector over all 65
 * produced **one** report — PR #1208, naming #1148 and #1157. Its second line
 * is the keyword and the number wrapped in backticks, the pull request says in
 * prose that the work is done and verified, and `closingIssuesReferences` is
 * empty. #1148 was rescued by the squash commit subject `fix(#1148): …`;
 * #1157 was not in the title and is still open.
 *
 * ## Why this reports the INERT ones and not the live ones
 *
 * A function that decided which references DO close an issue would be a second
 * decider competing with GitHub's own parser, and the two would agree on
 * almost every input — `.claude/rules/checks-must-be-able-to-fail.md`'s fourth
 * shape, where no behavioural test can tell a dead guard from a live one.
 *
 * This reports only what a caller can check against the API's own answer: the
 * caller already knows `closingIssuesReferences`, and an empty one beside a
 * keyword the author clearly meant is a disagreement worth refusing on. The
 * question asked here is "did you write something that looks like it closes an
 * issue and does not", which GitHub does not answer anywhere.
 *
 * ## Why the keyword must be ADJACENT to the number
 *
 * This repository writes negations constantly — `.claude/rules/` tells agents
 * never to put a closing keyword next to an issue number they are not closing,
 * and they comply by writing the denial in prose instead.
 *
 * The negative control, over the same 65 merged pull requests: loosening
 * "adjacent" to "within 40 characters" produced **21** candidates, of which
 * the same two were true and **19** were false. Three kinds of false, and only
 * the first is a negation:
 *
 * - a denial — `Closes nothing — #523 stays open`, `Fixes nothing on its own —
 *   leaving #713 open`, `Neither issue is closed by this PR`;
 * - prose about a DIFFERENT issue — `| #1281 | … | fixed, merged as #1288 |`;
 * - a window artefact, where the 40 characters end mid-number and the
 *   candidate names an issue nobody wrote.
 *
 * So adjacency is not a convenience, it is the whole precision of the check,
 * and widening it is the cheapest wrong fix available here: on the only corpus
 * that exists, the loosened rule is wrong nineteen times out of twenty-one.

/**
 * A pull request whose BRANCH names an issue and which declares no closing
 * reference at all (#1950).
 *
 * The sibling of `inertClosingReferences`, and the half it could not see.
 * That function asks "did you write a reference GitHub cannot read"; this one
 * asks "did you write one at all". PR #1903 answered no to the second and was
 * never asked: branch `rg/1717-phase6-readings`, title identical to issue
 * #1717, merged 2026-11-08 as `dd8709e6`, `closingIssuesReferences` empty and
 * no keyword anywhere in the body. The check passed it, #1717 stayed open,
 * and its card sat in `In review` for two days.
 *
 * ## Why the branch name, and not the title
 *
 * Nothing may require EVERY pull request to close an issue — a state record,
 * a docs pass and a dependency bump all legitimately close nothing, and a
 * check that fired on them is one people route around. So the question is
 * which pull requests OWED a reference, and the branch is the one place this
 * repository already answers it: `rg/1717-phase6-readings`,
 * `fix/640-644-run-branch-base`, `rungate/run-1931`. A title is prose and a
 * body is prose; a branch name is a decision somebody made before they wrote
 * either.
 *
 * `issueFromBranch` is imported rather than re-derived. It is the same
 * positional rule `lib/local-work.ts` uses to attribute a commit, and it
 * already refuses the shapes that would make this check wrong —
 * `jason-patch-1` is not issue #1 and `rg/adr-011-plan` is not issue #11.
 * Two parsers for "which issue is this branch for" would be two deciders
 * that agree, the fourth shape in
 * `.claude/rules/checks-must-be-able-to-fail.md`.
 *
 * ## What it deliberately does NOT check
 *
 * Whether the declared reference is the branch's own issue. A branch cut for
 * #1717 may legitimately close the sibling it turned into, and insisting on
 * the number would put this function in an argument with the author it cannot
 * win. **Declaring something is the bar.** That keeps the rule where the
 * evidence is: every instance measured — #1717 via PR #1903, and #1168 —
 * declared nothing at all.
 *
 * Returns `null` when nothing is owed. `headRefName` is required by the
 * caller before this is reached; a branch that could not be read is
 * UNMEASURED there, never a quiet pass here.
