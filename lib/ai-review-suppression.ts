/**
 * CRC-N4's suppression gate — the production caller `suppressRepeats` never
 * had (#1586).
 *
 * `lib/ai-review-rounds.ts` has exported `carryKey → suppressRepeats` since
 * #1351 and nothing called either. #1381 shipped the WALKER — the generated
 * `ai-review-carry` step reads the ledger and hands the reviewer the
 * unresolved set — so a repeat became *marked* rather than *dropped*. This is
 * the half that drops it.
 *
 * ## Since AC-1 the prior set is the pull request's review threads
 *
 * The ledger keyed a repeat by `file + cited line text + summary`, which a
 * reformat moves — measured on #1616 as 11 threads for 3 findings. A thread
 * is GitHub's own answer to the same question, so AC-1 moved the gate onto
 * it: `priorKeysFrom` reads the list the carry step fetched and nothing else.
 * The ledger reader is kept as `ledgerPriorKeysFrom`, called by no production
 * path, until AC-5 stops writing the snapshot it parses.
 *
 * ## Why the prior state arrives as a file and not as a fetch
 *
 * Unchanged, and for a sharper reason than before. The generated job runs
 * `ai-review-carry` → the reviewer → `ai-review-threads` (the poster, **which
 * posts this round's threads**) → `ai-review-run` (this gate). So a fetch
 * here would not be safe at all: by the time this gate runs, the poster has
 * already opened this round's threads, and a live fetch would read them as
 * prior, suppress the entire payload and report CLEAN forever.
 *
 * The file is what makes the gate correct, and it does not depend on where in
 * a YAML file somebody put a step. The carry step runs before the reviewer,
 * so the list it writes cannot contain this round's work whatever the later
 * order becomes. `test/ai-review-suppression.test.ts` (AS-4) asserts the
 * ordering that matters — `ai-review-carry` precedes both the poster and this
 * gate — rather than the one this comment used to assert.
 *
 * ## Every refusal suppresses NOTHING
 *
 * There is one direction of error this module is allowed to make. Re-posting
 * an advisory that was already answered is loud, cheap and self-correcting;
 * dropping a finding that is still live is silent and permanent. So a thread
 * list that was never fetched, one that was cut off mid-write, and one that
 * parsed into something that is not a list all produce the same behaviour —
 * report everything — and each produces a DIFFERENT sentence saying so
 * (AC-4), because "nothing was a repeat" and "nothing could be compared" are
 * different facts about this round's report.
 *
 * ## It never sees a blocking finding
 *
 * `findingMustAlwaysBeReported` in `lib/scaffold/ai-review-findings.ts`
 * filters before anything reaches this gate. The exemption is structural, not
 * a rule this module is trusted to follow — see that predicate for the
 * measurement, and for the declared deviation from the spec it rests on.

/**
 * THE PRIOR SET, read from the pull request's own review threads (AC-1).
 *
 * ## Why a thread and not the ledger
 *
 * The ledger answers "was this raised before?" with a text heuristic —
 * `file + the text at the cited line + summary` — and a reformat moves the
 * key, so round 4 cannot tell it is re-raising round 1's finding. Measured on
 * #1616: **11 threads for 3 distinct findings**, re-raised across four rounds
 * while the line numbers moved under them. A thread is the authoritative
 * answer to the same question: the comment is on the pull request, or it is
 * not.
 *
 * ## A RESOLVED thread is still a prior key
 *
 * This is the one place this reader and `carryForwardFromThreads` deliberately
 * disagree, and the difference is the question each is asking:
 *
 * | Reader | Question | Resolved thread |
 * |---|---|---|
 * | this gate | has this already been **raised**? | yes — do not post it twice |
 * | carry-forward | is this still **unanswered**? | no — a human answered it |
 *
 * A gate that treated resolution as "not raised" would re-post a thread the
 * moment someone resolved it, which is the duplicate-per-round failure the
 * whole increment exists to prevent, aimed at the people who are doing the
 * work.
 *
 * ## Self-suppression is prevented by WHERE THE LIST IS FETCHED, not by a guard
 *
 * The ledger reader needed a provenance header because the ledger is written
 * *during* the job, before the adjudicator reads it. Threads are no better on
 * that count — `ai-review-threads` posts this round's threads BEFORE
 * `ai-review-run` adjudicates, so a list fetched at adjudication time would
 * contain them.
 *
 * What rules self-suppression out is that the list is not fetched here. It is
 * fetched by `ai-review-carry`, which runs before the reviewer and therefore
 * before anything this round could have posted, and handed to this gate as a
 * file. That property lives in the workflow's step order and is asserted
 * there; see `test/ai-review-suppression.test.ts` (AS-4), which pins
 * `ai-review-carry` ahead of both the poster and the adjudicator.
 *
 * Exported and pure so the battery can drive every refusal without a
 * filesystem, and so there is one place to mutate.

 * computing a weaker version of the same key, it is computing keys in a
 * DIFFERENT NAMESPACE from the ledger's. The ledger records `recordedText`
 * and keys `t:<text>`; a text-less caller keys `n:<line>`; the two never
 * collide, so the dedupe silently suppresses nothing and every round looks
 * like a round with no repeats. Measured before this landed: `kept: 1,
 * suppressed: 0` on a planted exact repeat.
 *
 * A line that cannot be read yields `undefined` and the finding falls back to
 * the number anchor — asymmetric again, for that one finding, and therefore
 * reported rather than dropped.
 *
 * `root` bounds it. A payload is written by the reviewer and names its own
 * paths, so `../../etc/passwd` is an input this must handle; `resolve`
 * normalises the `..` away, which is why the containment test is on the
