/**
 * Whether a filing was planned — the cap's second route.
 *
 * `FILINGS_PER_RUN` is 1 per checkout per day and it is deliberately not
 * configurable: a cap read from config is a cap an agent raises. That number
 * was calibrated against one population, a REVIEW FINDING filed mid-change —
 * Cloudflare's 1.2 findings per review, and this machine's 0.23 filings per
 * run per day across 284 worktrees.
 *
 * Decomposing a spec criterion into issues is a different population. It is
 * the thing the backlog is supposed to fill with, it is authored before
 * anything is created, and by design it produces SEVERAL issues in one run. A
 * cap of 1 does not slow that down, it forbids it — so a tool whose whole job
 * is step 4 of ADR-003 could not exist under the cap, and the version of it
 * that did exist would be the one that never asked.
 *
 * ## Why this is a count and not a judgement
 *
 * The gate's own record says a BAR gets argued into: on 2026-10-24 three of
 * three filings cleared *"it makes a green check lie"*, each on an
 * individually sound argument. So the exemption here is not "this filing is
 * planned work" — an agent can say that about anything. It is:
 *
 *   the title appears, verbatim, in a plan file that is committed on
 *   `origin/main`
 *
 * which an agent cannot argue into. It has to get a plan reviewed and merged
 * first — and that merged plan is exactly the human reading the cap stands in
 * for. The plan file is the reservation, in the same sense
 * `specs/sc-reservations.json` is.
 *
 * ## Four properties, each the opposite of a way this could be beaten
 *
 * - **Read from `origin/main`, never the working tree.** A plan file sitting
 *   uncommitted beside the filing is not a reviewed plan, and a stale tree
 *   and a missing file look identical from inside one. `git show
 *   origin/main:<path>` is the whole of the difference.
 * - **The filer does not choose the plan.** No path argument. The directory
 *   is `PLAN_DIR`, fixed here. A `--plan` flag would let an agent nominate
 *   its own exemption, which is the cap with extra steps.
 * - **Exact equality, never a substring.** `lib/issue-create-override.ts`
 *   records what the other spelling cost: `cmd.includes('follow-up')` passed
 *   any command with the word anywhere in it, including inside a title. A
 *   substring match here would exempt every filing whose title contains a
 *   planned one.
 * - **Fail CLOSED.** Every failure to read — no git, no such ref, no such
 *   directory, an unparseable file — returns `planned: false`. This is the
 *   opposite direction from the dedupe's fail-open, and deliberately: a
 *   dedupe that cannot run costs a duplicate, and an exemption that cannot be
 *   read would cost the cap itself.

/**
 * Every title a plan file authorises.
 *
 * A table qualifies when one of its header cells is exactly `TITLE_COLUMN`;
 * the titles are that column's cells in the rows beneath it. A file may hold
 * several such tables and none of them has to be the first table in the file,
 * because a plan that opens with a summary table is the normal shape.
 *
 * An empty cell is not a title. Without that, a table with a blank Outcome
 * authorises a filing whose title is the empty string — and `gh` will not
 * create one, but `createIssue` through Octokit would.
 *
 * **A fenced block, an indented block and an HTML comment are not plan
 * content.** An ADR that shows what a plan table should look like, inside a
 * ` ``` ` fence, or that keeps a superseded table commented out, is the
 * normal shape in this repository — `.claude/rules/*.md` are mostly
 * illustrative markdown inside fences. Reading any of them as live would let
 * an EXAMPLE authorise a filing, so the "an agent cannot argue into this"
 * property would hold only for files nobody wrote an example in.
 *
 * ## Agreeing with the renderer is the whole requirement
 *
 * The reviewer of a plan reads what GitHub renders. This function reads the
 * bytes. **Every place the two disagree is a filing a reviewer approved
 * without seeing**, so this is not markdown parsing for its own sake — the
 * differential IS the bypass. Four were found, all in the same direction:
 * rendered inert, parsed live. Each is handled to CommonMark's rule and each
 * has a case below.
 *
 * - A closing fence may not carry an info string. ` ```js ` after an open
 *   ` ```md ` does not close it, so a parser that accepts it treats the rest
 *   of a code block as a plan.
 * - Four or more leading spaces is an indented code block.
 * - A comment nests by position, not by whether the line *contains* a
 *   delimiter: `-->` followed by `<!--` on one line leaves the comment open,
 *   and `includes` cannot see order.
 *
 * Where a reading stays ambiguous it is resolved toward NOT authorising: an
 * unclosed fence makes the rest of the file inert, a table indented under a
 * list item is not counted, a row cut short by a comment opening mid-line is
 * dropped, and a marker run CommonMark would reject as an opener opens one
 * here anyway. Each of those costs somebody a row they have to move and merge
 * again. The other direction costs the cap.
