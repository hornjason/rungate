/**
 * Repairing an issue's link back to the spec — step 4 of ADR-003, in reverse.
 *
 * `plan-spec` derives milestones from the spec and `plan-deps` derives the
 * order from the milestones. Both read DOWN from the spec. This reads a
 * repair plan a person wrote and applies it UP: an issue that names no
 * criterion is invisible to `criterion-inventory`, to `plan-spec`'s coverage
 * report and to `board-mirror`'s Criteria column, because all three match the
 * criterion id as literal text in the body.
 *
 * Measured 2026-10-29: 11 of 39 open convergence issues named no criterion.
 * The classification of all eleven is
 * `docs/adr/ADR-005-backlog-criterion-repair.md`, approved by Jason.
 *
 * ## The judgement is in the plan file, never here
 *
 * Which criterion an issue serves is an adjudication. This file parses a
 * table somebody reviewed and refuses anything it cannot read, rather than
 * inferring a link from an issue's title — a tool that guessed would write a
 * criterion id into a body and make `plan-spec` report a phase as covered
 * when nothing is working on it. That is the coverage report lying in the
 * direction that hides a gap.
 *
 * ## DEMOTE removes the milestone, and that is not a close
 *
 * A phase milestone means *this phase of the spec*. An issue in it serving no
 * criterion keeps the milestone open after every criterion is true, so nobody
 * can tell real remaining work from a stray card — and `plan-deps` blocks the
 * whole next phase on it. Closing instead would destroy the measurements in
 * those bodies and move both sides of the opened-against-closed ratio
 * `AGENTS.md` rule 7 asks us to watch.
