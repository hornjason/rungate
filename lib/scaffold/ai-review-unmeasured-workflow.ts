/**
 * The workflow that runs the unmeasured classifier automatically (#1488).
 *
 * #1486 shipped the classifier — `lib/ai-review-unmeasured.ts` — and a
 * recorder somebody has to type, `scripts/record-ai-review-unmeasured.ts`.
 * It works: #1470's ledger comment carries five `"unmeasured": "declined"`
 * beside five intact `"findings": null`. What it does not do is run, and the
 * evidence it reads has a deadline. Actions logs expire, so every round whose
 * log ages out loses its discriminator permanently. The classifier makes the
 * question answerable; until this file it did not make it answered.
 *
 * ## Why this is a second workflow and not a step in the ai-review job
 *
 * The persist step runs MID-JOB, between the reviewer and the adjudicator,
 * and `gh run view --job <id> --log` on a running job answers
 *
 * ```
 * run <id> is still in progress; logs will be available when it is complete
 * ```
 *
 * There is no moment inside that job at which the log exists to be read. Two
 * older readings agree and are now corroboration rather than the argument:
 * `AI_REVIEW_APP_INSTALL_CAUSE`'s docblock (*"A later step cannot read a
 * previous step's stdout"*, #803), and `test/ai-review-payload-reading.test.ts`
 * AC-6, which refuses the action's skip prose anywhere in the generated
 * script because *"the check cannot tell a grep from a mention"*.
 *
 * `workflow_run: completed` fires after the job ends, which is the first
 * moment the log is served.
 *
 * ## It is not a required check and it must never look like one
 *
 * A `workflow_run` workflow reports no status to the pull request, so it
 * cannot gate anything and cannot hang a merge queue. That is why it is the
 * one generated workflow with no `merge_group` trigger —
 * `test/merge-group-trigger.test.ts` narrows its population to the workflows
 * that CAN be required, and `test/ai-review-unmeasured-workflow.test.ts`
 * AC-7 asserts this file is outside it for the stated reason rather than by
 * being forgotten.
 *
 * ## The subscription is DERIVED, not spelled twice
 *
 * `workflow_run.workflows` matches on a workflow's `name:`. Two literals
 * reading `AI Review` in two files is two deciders agreeing, and a rename of
 * one would leave this workflow subscribed to a workflow that no longer
 * exists — firing never, which is indistinguishable from firing and finding
 * nothing to classify. So `AI_REVIEW_WORKFLOW_NAME` is declared here, the
 * generated `ai-review.yml` renders its `name:` from it, and AC-8 asserts
 * the subscription names the workflow the generator actually produced.
 *
 * ## The known boundary: two of these jobs can lose one reading
 *
 * The ledger PATCH is a read-modify-write of one comment. Two review rounds
 * finishing close together fire two of these jobs, both read the ledger
 * before either writes, and the later write can drop the earlier round's
 * discriminator. Recorded rather than papered over, because the obvious fix
 * is worse: a `concurrency:` group holds at most one pending run and
 * **cancels** whatever arrives behind it, so a burst would classify nothing
 * at all — and a cancelled run and a run that found nothing to classify are
 * the same absence, which is this feature's own defect.
 *
 * The recovery is the one #1488 already names. A round that lost its
 * reading still reads NOT_RECORDED, so the next round on that pull request
 * records it, and `scripts/record-ai-review-unmeasured.ts` over a window
 * catches whatever is left while its log still exists.

 * The `name:` of the workflow that produces the rounds this one classifies.

 * `.claude/rules/checks-must-be-able-to-fail.md` opens with.
 *
 * ## Every line of it is about one of two conflations
 *
 * **An absent sha is UNMEASURED, not "no rounds to classify".** A
 * `workflow_run` payload with no `head_sha` is a reading that could not be
 * taken. Exiting 0 silently here would report the same thing as a run that
 * read forty rounds and found them all already recorded.
 *
 * **The recorder's own exit code is this step's.** It exits non-zero when it
 * REFUSED a pull request — an unlocatable fence, a body that would not read
 * back, a failed PATCH — and those are the cases where a round's reading was
 * taken and then dropped, with the log now one day closer to expiry. A
 * `continue-on-error` or a `|| true` here would convert each of them into a
 * green check, which is this feature's own defect reintroduced in its
 * delivery mechanism.
 *
 * Note what is NOT here: no filter on the finished run's conclusion. A
 * declined run SUCCEEDS — the action exits zero on its own
 * workflow-validation guard — so `if: failure()` would skip exactly the
 * population #1455 is about, and `conclusion == 'success'` would admit it by
 * accident rather than on purpose. The classifier reads the log; nothing
 * upstream of it gets to pre-judge which runs are worth reading.

# \`findings: null\` — a round nobody read — and nothing said whether that was

# that cannot tell them apart is a row nobody can act on.
#
# The evidence is the finished run's FULL job log, and it is only readable

# and the Actions log endpoint refuses a job that is still running. Hence a
# second workflow on \`workflow_run: completed\` rather than a step.
#
# THIS WORKFLOW REPORTS NO STATUS TO THE PULL REQUEST. A \`workflow_run\`
# workflow cannot be a required check and cannot hang a merge queue, which is
# why — alone among the generated workflows — it declares no \`merge_group\`
# trigger. Do not add one: it would fire with no \`workflow_run\` context.
