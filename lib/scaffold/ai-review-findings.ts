/**
 * scaffold/ai-review-findings.ts — the AI review's findings contract, and the
 * blocking verdict derived from it (#631).
 *
 * ## Why the agent's verdict word is not the decider
 *
 * The reviewer is an agent, and an agent grading its own gate is the shape
 * this repo distrusts most. So the contract is: the agent writes a payload of
 * findings, each carrying a severity, and the blocking decision is computed
 * HERE from those severities. The verdict word is read for exactly one
 * purpose — to notice that the agent contradicted its own payload — and never
 * to decide anything. `prevalidationViolations` in `gates/workflow.test.ts` is
 * the shape being copied: a PASS carrying broken ids is a contradiction, not a
 * pass. Without that branch a writer could record the blocking list faithfully
 * and still be waved through, which is the fail-open that survives every test
 * written only against the happy path.
 *
 * ## Why the key is a constant and not a string
 *
 * #295, in that same function: the reader asked for `reading.broken`, a key no
 * writer ever produced and the schema never declared. The list was empty on
 * every run, so every FAIL fell through to "no broken ids were recorded" — an
 * absent key reads as an empty list reads as clean. One exported constant is
 * the whole fix: the step that reads the payload and the prompt that tells the
 * agent what to write name the same binding, so they cannot drift, and
 * `test/ai-review-findings.test.ts` fails the suite if a second spelling of it
 * appears anywhere in this module.
 *
 * ## Why the payload contract is read back (#1166)
 *
 * The prompt states a contract — "every one of those member names is required
 * on every finding" — and until #1166 nothing checked it. This module
 * validated a severity and a verdict word; `AI_REVIEW_FINDING_FIELDS` was
 * consumed only by `renderFinding`, which printed `(no file recorded)` and
 * carried on. So a BLOCKING finding with a fabricated `failure_scenario`, no
 * `file` and no `line` adjudicated identically to one with real evidence
 * under it, and the module's own philosophy — do not take the agent's word
 * for it — reached one level short of the thing the agent is asked to write.
 *
 * It is read back on blocking findings and nowhere else. See
 * `blockingContractViolations` for why that line and not a stricter one.
 *
 * ## Why so many ways to be UNMEASURED
 *
 * `0`, `{}`, `null` and `SKIP` are indistinguishable from success; UNMEASURED
 * is not (`.claude/rules/config-access.md`). A payload this module cannot read
 * is a review whose result nobody knows, and the states it can be in — no
 * file, unreadable file, not JSON, no declared key, a finding with no severity
 * — are different facts with different fixes, so each is named. None of them
 * reads as clean, and the derived decision is WITHHELD rather than defaulted:
 * `blocked` is `null` under an UNMEASURED reading.
 *
 * ## Where a finding points, and why that is not a question about whether it
 * is right (#1204)
 *
 * A blocking finding may name a file the pull request never touched. #1166
 * made a finding missing `file`, `line`, `summary` or `failure_scenario` its
 * own reading; that is a check on whether the payload is SELF-consistent, and
 * the payload is all it needs. "The file is not in the diff" compares the
 * payload against the PULL REQUEST, so it needs a second input — the list of
 * paths the pull request changed — and the reading is withheld until it has
 * one.
 *
 * **This is not a correctness filter and must never become one.** Nothing
 * here asks whether a finding is RIGHT. A reviewer that is wrong about real
 * code is a review problem, and suppressing findings on suspicion of being
 * wrong is the fail-open this module exists against. The only question asked
 * is whether the finding can be LOCATED, which is decidable from the diff
 * without reading the claim at all.
 *
 * And an unlocatable finding is **demoted, never dropped**. The tempting
 * repair is to filter it out of the blocking list and let the run go green —
 * which makes a review that discarded a finding byte-indistinguishable from a
 * review that found nothing. So CRC-B7 tags it `Pre-existing`: the finding is
 * carried in `reported` and in `unlocatableReported`, named in the
 * annotation, counted on the scope line, and does not get to block on its
 * own.
 *
 * #1204 wrote that refusal as `BLOCKING_FINDING_UNLOCATABLE`, a red required
 * check. CRC-B7's demotion satisfies #1204's own stated criterion — the
 * finding is not DROPPED — and does not redden a pull request over a defect
 * that was already on main, so the refusal is gone and the demotion is what
 * ships. The two were written against the same input on different branches;
 * this is the resolution, not an accident of the merge.
 *
 * The second input is NOT SUPPLIED by any generated job yet, and the absent
 * state is named rather than silently skipped — `scope.status` is
 * `NOT_SUPPLIED`, `main` prints it on every run, and the verdict is exactly
 * what it was before. That is deliberately the third option, against the two
 * #1204 tabulated: skipping silently is Silent Default Substitution, and
 * refusing an absent list would redden consumers for a reason about our
 * release rather than about their code. The generated step runs
 * `bunx rungate@<generating version>`, so a consumer's workflow and its
 * adjudicator always come from the SAME release and cannot skew apart; the
 * absent state is reachable from a hand-run CLI and from a workflow older
 * than the half that supplies the list.
 *
 * ## The exit code
 *
 * Every refusal routes through `AI_REVIEW_REQUIRED_EXIT`, imported from
 * `./ai-review-step` and never re-declared here. One site to mutate, so
 * `test/ai-review-exit-binding.test.ts` can zero it and prove each refusal is
 * what the case observed. A later branch inlining its own literal would
 * survive that mutation and the case would go green having witnessed nothing.

 * the line genuinely does not matter, and keying on it would split one

 *
 * Its sibling is `carryKey` in `lib/ai-review-rounds.ts`, which is the

 * raised" — over `file` + the cited line's TEXT + `summary`, and partial: it
 * returns `null` for a finding it cannot key, which this hash cannot do. The

 * name no call site could say which it had asked.
 *
 * CRC-B8 asks that every finding be answered — fixed, or resolved with a

 * cannot be that name: the same finding moves line between rounds, which is
 * exactly what #1319 measured (`bash-write-guard.ts:90 → :97` across two
 * rounds of #1213 was *one* finding). So the key is over the file and the

 * over the severity either — a reviewer that re-rates the same observation
 * has not produced a second finding.
 *
 * FNV-1a, written out, rather than `node:crypto`. Not a preference: this
 * module is copied into a temp directory by the mutation battery in
 * `test/ai-review-advisory-findings.test.ts`, and every import it carries has
 * to be carried with it. The property wanted is determinism and a short
 * printable token, not collision resistance against an adversary.
 *
 * ## WHAT A COLLISION COSTS, and it is no longer only an annotation
 *
 * This docblock used to end *"a finding that forged another finding's key
 * would buy the forger an answer on the wrong row, which is a worse
 * annotation and not a bypass of anything."* That stopped being true the
 * moment CRC-B4 made the verifier quorum read a ballot filed under this
 * key: a collision between two BLOCKING findings would let one group's vote
 * decide both. The sentence is corrected rather than deleted because a
 * comment asserting a property the code no longer has is the reason nobody
 * checks it — `lib/cli-commands.ts` carried *"runs every command for real"*
 * over a test that ran one command of ten.
 *
 * What holds instead, and it is a property of the CALLER rather than of
 * this hash: `juryGate` derives the identity once over the whole blocking
 * set, refuses a key two of them share, and carries its decision back to
 * the reader **by position**. So a collision is seen and both findings keep
 * blocking; it cannot silently credit one finding's vote to another. The
 * hash is still not adversary-resistant and is not asked to be — nothing
 * downstream of it decides anything a collision could not already be
 * refused for.

 * print the advisory tail twice, and that module's own comment says why that
 * is worse than printing it once: *a duplicate reads as two findings*. The
 * rule lives here, in one function, rather than as a condition at the call
 * site, so there is one binding to mutate.
 *
 * ## What this does NOT do
 *
 * It decides nothing. `aiReviewExitCode` is untouched and reads only the
 * outcome, so an advisory finding does not block and cannot be made to block
 * from here. Surfacing a finding and adjudicating one are different jobs, and
 * this module already holds the second; a notice that quietly became a

 * ## Why an outcome claim is unfounded here by construction
 *
 * `.github/workflows/ai-review.yml` runs no test command of any kind. The
 * reviewer reads source and the diff; it never sees a result. So a finding
 * saying a named case fails is always an inference, and on #1878 the same
 * inference blocked three rounds running and was wrong all three times.
 *
 * That instance arrived through the restore — `.claude` is in
 * `AI_REVIEW_UNTRUSTED_PATHS`, so the reviewer read the BASE's ratchet file
 * beside the branch's source and concluded a case must fail. **The restore
 * is not what makes the claim unfounded**, and a check built around it would
 * be narrower than the defect: the same sentence about a file nothing
 * restores is just as unobserved. The prompt already forbids the
 * restore-shaped version of this, in those words, and was ignored anyway —
 * which is the argument for deciding it here rather than instructing it
 * again.
 *
 * ## What this is allowed to get wrong, and in which direction
 *
 * It is a text detector over prose, which is the shape this repository keeps
 * catching itself on, so the bound is stated rather than implied:
 *
 * - **A false negative is the status quo.** Today every one of these blocks.
 * - **A false positive costs a finding its blocking status and nothing
 *   else** — it stays in `reported` and reaches the maintainer in full.
 *
 * Both halves must land in ONE sentence, because "this test file is new"
 * followed by "the build is broken" is two statements and neither is a
 * claim about a case's outcome.
 *
 * The returned string is the sentence itself, so the refusal quotes what it
 * matched instead of asserting that it matched something.

 * is not something `required_conversation_resolution` can read. So a repo
 * that switches that protection on gets a gate with no producer — satisfied
 * by construction, because nothing it governs is ever created.
 *
 * Three decisions are worth stating, because each has a cheaper wrong answer:
 *
 * **`unlocatableReported` is subtracted, and `null` subtracts nothing.** A
 * finding naming a file the pull request does not touch has no line in this
 * diff to hang off, so the API would refuse it. `null` is the scope check not
 * having run — see `AiReviewFindingsReading.unlocatableReported` — and a
 * reading that could not locate anything must not be read as one that located
 * everything. Membership is by IDENTITY, not by a key rebuilt from the
 * finding's fields: the field set is caller-supplied and two findings can
 * share every value in it, and `unlocatableReported` is already a subset of
 * `reported` by reference.
 *
 * **`normaliseRepoPath` decides whether a path is readable and never supplies
 * the value.** It lowercases, deliberately, because its job is to make two
 * spellings of one path compare equal. The API's job is the opposite: `path`
 * is matched against the diff exactly and a case difference is a 422. Those
 * two requirements fit in one function only if you never notice they are
 * different.
 *
 * **An unreadable line demotes rather than drops.** Being in the changed set
 * makes a finding locatable to a FILE; it does not prove the line sits inside
 * a hunk, which is a separate 422 the caller has to be able to fall back
 * from. Dropping here would silently lose findings whose only defect is that
 * the reviewer wrote no line number.
 *
 * **A finding whose file is not in the diff is not requested, blocking or
 * not.** `unlocatableReported` is populated by `readPayload`'s DEMOTION
 * branch, and that branch only runs for a finding that BLOCKS — so the
 * subtraction above cannot see a non-blocking finding carried forward onto a
 * path this branch has since stopped touching. It was sent, and GitHub
 * answered `422 pull_request_review_thread.path "could not be resolved"` at
 * the line AND again at file level, because the caller's demotion answers
 * "the line moved" and has no answer for "the file left". That lands in
 * `failed`, the one refusing outcome. Observed on #1740 head
 * `1d95e1da457cf5fc91298bd017a94087b8244d46`, run `41950364518`: two carried
 * findings on `lib/github.ts`, `0 of 2 posted`, exit 1, and a required check
 * permanently red over a branch with nothing wrong in it.
 *
 * The two skips are NOT the fourth shape in
 * `.claude/rules/checks-must-be-able-to-fail.md`, because each has an input
 * the other cannot answer: a MEASURED scope with `unlocatableReported` null

 * Findings that are reported on EVERY round, whatever an earlier round said.

 * ## This is the whole of CRC-N4's safety, and it is named for what it protects
 *
 * The deployed reviewer prompt (`buildReviewPrompt`) tells the reviewer:
 *
 * > CHECK EACH CARRIED FINDING AGAINST THE CODE AND RE-REPORT THE ONES THAT
 * > ARE STILL TRUE … A carried finding you silently leave out is a finding
 * > that has stopped being reported, and that is how a live defect reaches a
 * > green check.
 *
 * So on every round after the first, a live unresolved finding is **supposed**
 * to be in the payload, and it is key-identical to the one the ledger
 * recorded. Subtracting it is therefore not a de-duplication: it is the
 * deletion of the one signal the gate has. MEASURED on the real functions
 * before this was written — a round-1 blocking finding, re-reported on round 2
 * exactly as instructed, run through `suppressRepeats` with the ledger's keys:
 *
 * ```
 * kept: 0   suppressed: 1   severity of what survives: []
 * ```
 *
 * `blocking.length === 0` → `blocked: false` → `CLEAN`, which is a green
 * required check over a defect a previous round blocked on. That is
 * SUCCESS.md claim 4 failing inside this repository's own merge gate.
 *
 * ## Unclassified is protected too, and that is the three-state reading
 *
 * `severityBlocks` answers `true`, `false`, or `null` for a severity the
 * table does not declare. Only an explicit `false` — a severity this module
 * knows and knows does not block — is ever offered for suppression. `null`
 * is not "does not block"; it is "nobody classified this", and dropping it
 * would let an unrecognised severity become the way round the exemption.
 *
 * ## Widening this is a decision about the merge gate
 *
 * Anything that makes this return `false` more often lets a repeat stop
 * blocking. `test/ai-review-suppression.test.ts` mutates it to a constant
 * `false` and asserts the verdict flips from BLOCKED to CLEAN — the count
 * alone is not the assertion, because a count can stay right while the
 * verdict moves, and the verdict is the thing that gates.
 *
 * Recorded as a declared deviation from `specs/CODE-REVIEW-CONVERGENCE-SPEC.md`
 * line 480, which says the adjudicator should drop any finding matching an
 * earlier round's key. The prompt above is the newer artefact and the correct

 * at once on 2026-10-23.
 *
 * ## #1204 and CRC-B7 answered the same question and this merge picked one
 *
 * Both asked *does this finding apply to this pull request?* over the same
 * input. #1204 refused — `BLOCKING_FINDING_UNLOCATABLE`, a red required
 * check. CRC-B7 demotes. **CRC-B7 owns the case**, because #1204's answer
 * makes its own motivating measurement worse: under it each of those nine

 * near a defect on `main` is unmergeable until somebody fixes `main`. That is
 * worse than the state it was fixing. CRC-B7 also grades the error direction,
 * which the refusal does not: an undecidable path keeps blocking, and a
 * non-string path is a contract violation rather than a demotion input.
 *
 * What #1204 keeps is the INPUT layer — `scope`, three states as a type
 * rather than as conventions over a nullable array. It is the only side that
 * can tell "nobody handed this run a list" from "every finding was
 * locatable", and those are the two readings a green check must not conflate.
 * It defaults to NOT_SUPPLIED, under which nothing is demoted and the reading
 * is exactly what it was before any of this existed.
 *
 * The finding's DECLARED `file` is the input, not a path mined out of its
 * prose. `blockingContractViolations` already refuses a blocking finding that
 * carries none, and `lib/finding-jury.ts`'s `citedPaths` text-mines only
 * because the arbiter's findings arrive as prose. Mining a field the payload
 * declares would be a second decider for a question already answered.

 * The second argument is optional: a caller that does not pass one gets

  //
  // WHAT IT DOES NOT DO IS SUBTRACT, and that is a decision with two
  // reasons, both of them properties of the tree rather than of this
  // function:
  //
  //  - **The group is not independent yet.** `AI_REVIEW_ALLOWED_TOOLS`
  //    grants the review action `Read,Grep,Glob,Write` and
  //    `AI_REVIEW_DENY_RULES` denies `Task`, so one invocation cannot spawn
  //    verifiers. Independence has to be a property of the WORKFLOW — one
  //    action invocation per verifier — and a ballot that subtracts before
  //    that holds is a quorum wired to a constant: populated, plausible,
  //    and filtering nothing. That is the counterfeit CRC-B4 names.
  //  - **The verifier reads the head checkout.** A subtracting ballot would
  //    make the branch under review an input to the gate on the branch
  //    under review.
  //
  // So the votes are counted, written to the finding ledger at decision
  // time, and announced. Nothing below reads `gate` except the annotation.
  // CRC-B4's *"surfaced only if enough agree"* clause is therefore NOT
  // satisfied, and the spec says so rather than this comment alone.
  //
  // **The ballot directory is NOT a third positional argument**, and that
  // is deliberate rather than incidental. `argumentsBeyondTheContract`
  // refuses `argv[2]` and up, and one of the invocations it catches is a
  // changed-file path containing a space that an unquoted expansion
  // word-split into two — `test/ai-review-changed-files-step.test.ts`
  // CF-6 names that case. Widening the contract by one slot to carry a
  // ballot would turn that refusal into an accepted argv whose second
  // half is read as a ballot directory. So the directory binds at the
  // wrapper, which closes over it and hands this function a gate or
  // `null`; "no ballot" and "a ballot nothing reads" collapse into one
