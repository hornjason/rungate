/**
 * Which files the scaffold owns, and how it writes each one (#208).
 *
 * `.claude/rules/harness-managed.md` says of five file classes:
 *
 *   > These files are managed by rungate and **regenerated on re-scaffold**.
 *   > Do not edit them directly.
 *
 * That is an ownership claim, and a maintainer who believes it correctly
 * declines to hand-edit a brief or a workflow and waits for a re-scaffold to
 * deliver improvements. So it has to be true.
 *
 * **It was true for four of the five.** Measured on this tree:
 *
 * | claimed file | what re-scaffold actually did |
 * |---|---|
 * | `.github/workflows/ci.yml` | regenerated, job-preserving — correct |
 * | `.github/workflows/gates.yml` | the same — correct |
 * | `.claude/agents/*.md` | rewritten every run — correct |
 * | `CODE-MAP.md` | rewritten, with a freshness skip — correct |
 * | `test/scaffold-conformity.test.ts` | **skipped forever** |
 *
 * The last one went through `safeWrite`, which returns early on
 * `existsSync`. Create-if-absent wearing the word "regenerated". The run
 * reported `SKIP: … (already exists)`, which is indistinguishable from
 * "already current" to anyone reading the log, and the claim converted a
 * fixable staleness into a permanent one.
 *
 * So the issue's framing — *every* `safeWrite` file drifts — is right about
 * the mechanism and overcounts the damage: of the five `safeWrite` call
 * sites only one is a file the harness claims to own. Two are files it does
 * not claim (`.github/copilot-instructions.md`, `specs/WORKFLOW-DEFINITION.md`),
 * and two must NEVER be rewritten (below). Stated plainly because a fix
 * scoped to the claim is a different change from a fix scoped to the helper.
 *
 * ## Why this file exists rather than a tighter `safeWrite`
 *
 * The defect is not that one helper returns early. It is that **ownership
 * was prose**. A table in a doc cannot be iterated, so nothing could notice
 * that one of its rows described behaviour the code did not have. Here the
 * declaration is data, the generator reads it, and a test reconciles it
 * against the doc in both directions.
 *
 * ## `project-state.json` and `PROJECT-STATE.md` are create-only, on purpose
 *
 * They look like scaffold artifacts and are listed here so that nothing
 * "tidies" them into the regenerated set later. They are **DA-owned** (#296):
 * a single shared state document that four parallel worktrees would each
 * overwrite with their own version. On 2026-10-11 run `wf_0b15a933-b2b` lost
 * four worktrees and 2,565 lines of validated work to exactly that. The
 * scaffold seeds them once and never touches them again.

 * repository stop being a fixed point of its own generator at the next
 * midnight.
 *
 * ## This is #827 again, through the hole its fix left
 *
 * #827 removed a `updated: today` that was forced AFTER the frontmatter
 * spread, and replaced it with a carry-forward in
 * `lib/generators/agents-md.ts`: keep the stamp when
 * `body === existingBody(root)`. That condition is **never true in this
 * repository and never can be.** AGENTS.md is written `section-preserving`,
 * so the file on disk carries `## Hard Constraints` — 3,357 bytes of body
 * against the generator's 1,352 on `aa7bc0c0` — and the generator does not
 * emit that section. It is merged in HERE, after the comparison has already
 * been made and lost.
 *
 * So the carry-forward never fired, the stamp was always today, and AC-2 of
 * `test/harness-fixed-point.test.ts` went green only on the calendar day
 * AGENTS.md was last committed. Measured: branch `rg/phase-placement` was
 * green at 23:09 and 23:20 UTC on 2026-10-28 and red from 00:22 on 2026-10-29,
 * the reddening commit being a documentation-only edit that touches neither
 * AGENTS.md nor any generator.
 *
 * ## Why the decision lives at the write site
 *
 * Because this is the first point that holds the FINAL bytes. Any comparison
 * made before `preserveSections` is comparing a document to a different
 * document and can only be wrong — which is exactly how the first fix failed.
 * `buildFrontmatter` no longer takes a `bodyUnchanged`: two deciders for
 * "may the stamp move" is the shape in
 * `.claude/rules/checks-must-be-able-to-fail.md`, and the one that could see
 * the answer was not the one being asked.
 *
 * Substitution, not deletion: a file whose content genuinely changed keeps
 * the generator's today, because the swap then fails to make the two equal
 * and `generated` is returned untouched.
