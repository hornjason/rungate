 *

 * `SKIP (already exists)`, which reads exactly like "already current". That
 * call site now uses `regenerateOwned`.
 *

 * that was performed; "seeded once" describes the policy, and a reader of
 * the log can tell that apart from "looked and found no difference".
 *
 * **It delegates rather than reimplementing, and that is load-bearing.** The
 * first draft read the decision and then branched on `action !== "create"`,
 * which is equivalent for every input `create-only` can produce today — and
 * exactly because it is equivalent, it ABSORBED a mutation: deleting the
 * `create-only` branch from `decideOwnedWrite` made every seeded file fall
 * through to the regenerate path, and `safeWrite` reported `UNCHANGED` and

/**
 * Rewrite `.claude/rules/` from a scan of the tree the run actually left (#123).
 *
 * The first pass happens in Phase 0.5, before `generateOrAuditProjectHarness`
 * creates `.claude/rungate/` and before `copySpecTemplateIfEmpty` creates
 * `specs/`. So a freshly scaffolded project shipped rules describing a tree that
 * no longer existed:
 *
 *   docs-routing.md  "Specs — ... (0 files)"   in a project with a spec
 *   key-files.md     `.claude/rungate.json`    the LEGACY monolith path, in a
 *                                              project using the directory layout
 *
 * The second one is the damaging one: it sends every agent in a new project to a
 * config file that is not there, and key-files.md is the table agents are told
 * to read first.
 *
 * Re-running the generator is safe and cheap: `generateAgentsMdContent` writes
 * only the rules, and returns AGENTS.md content for its caller to write. The
 * return value is discarded here on purpose — AGENTS.md has already been
 * through `injectEnvironmentSection` by this point, and rewriting it would
 * undo that.
 *
 * It used to say `updateSpecsTable` as well. That function ran immediately
 * after the generator had rewritten AGENTS.md, edited an EXISTING table
 * matched on a header row containing `Spec`, and the generator emits no such
 * table — so the match never succeeded, the `if` had no `else`, and its
 * action string never once appeared in a report. It is deleted (#382).

 * 2. `runDirectoryValidation` was missing. rungate's hand-adapted copy ran

 * `credentials.json`; the append branch derived its own form with
 * `e.includes("*") ? e : \`${e}/\``, which appends a trailing slash — and a

 * | Intended | Appended | Matches a file `credentials.json`? |
 * |---|---|---|
 * | `credentials.json` | `credentials.json/` | no |
 * | `service-account*` | `service-account/` | no |
 *
 * Six of the eight entries are directories, so the bug was invisible for them
 * and the block it broke is the one labelled "Environment and secrets" — the
 * two entries that are FILES are the two it silently inverted. The scaffold
 * reported `UPDATED: .gitignore (added 8 missing entries)` with two of them
 * inert, on exactly the path an existing project takes when it adopts
 * rungate. Found while scaffolding a plugin whose whole integration is Google
 * Drive, where `credentials.json` is the default client-secrets filename.
 *
 * So there is ONE list, and every pattern is written here EXACTLY as it must

 * once it stops being emitted. `mergeTopLevelSection`'s rule — a sub-key
 * only the consumer declares is the consumer's — is right for a LOCAL KNOB
 * and wrong for a DERIVED GRANT. `pull-requests: write` that a consumer
 * added for a job of their own is theirs. `id-token: write` that this
 * generator emitted because `ci.vertex` resolved is nobody's choice; the
 * config made it, and when the config goes the justification goes with it.
 * By the time the merge runs both are just lines in the consumer's file and
 * nothing records which side wrote them, so this records it instead.
 *
 * A sub-key named here is REMOVED from the consumer's section when that
 * file's generated side does not declare it. Add a conditionally emitted
 * sub-key in the same commit that makes it conditional.
 *
 * ## Keyed by FILE, which is the whole of the scoping
 *
 * The merge runs over every managed workflow. Keyed by section alone,
 * `permissions.id-token` becomes revocable in files whose generator never
 * emits it under any config — and all three of these emit a top-level
 * `permissions:`, so a consumer with a deploy job of their own would have
 * the grant withdrawn out of a workflow this feature was not reasoning
 * about. That is #923's own defect wearing the other hat: the issue is a
 * grant outliving its reason, and an unscoped revoker is a WITHDRAWAL
 * outliving its reason.
 *
 * Declared HERE rather than in `managed-workflow.ts` because the write loop
 * below is the only place that knows which file it is writing, and because
 * this module already spells that tuple as a literal for
 * `test/release-guard.test.ts`. A file absent from this map revokes nothing.
 *
 * ## Scoped to what the generator COMPUTES
 *
 * Not to everything it emits. `contents: read` is unconditional in all three
 * files, so both sides always declare it, #839's rule already settles it,
 * and an entry for it would be one no input can reach.
 * `test/scaffold-permissions-merge.test.ts` holds this map against the
 * generators themselves — it scaffolds every generated workflow with and
 * without the config that drives the grant and takes the per-file symmetric
 * difference of the emitted sub-keys — so the population is read off the
 * emitting module rather than off this list, and an entry for a file whose
 * generator never computes the sub-key is red.
 *
 * ## Not `ci.workflowOverrides`, which could not be the mechanism
 *
 * That is an opt-OUT: a consumer names a key and the merge stops touching
 * it. Revocation needs the opposite default, because the consumer who has
 * stopped using Vertex is exactly the consumer who will not think to declare
 * anything about it. The override still wins where it is declared — naming
 * the top-level key short-circuits `mergeTopLevelSection` before this is
 * read — so the escape hatch covers the path with no new config surface.

 *
 * ## What went wrong
 *
 * PR #1154 merged on run `39799846607`. `test-shard (1)`, `(2)` and `(3)` were
 * `queued` with `completed_at: null` and **no conclusion**; only shard 4 ran.
 * The aggregate read `needs.test-shard.result` as `success`, printed "All 4
 * shards passed", and went green in three seconds. `test` is a required check
 * and auto-merge is armed repo-wide, so a quarter of the suite authorised the
 * merge. The three preceding `main` runs were 4/4 — this was an anomaly, not
 * the pattern, and **the cause of the non-conclusion is unknown**. A fix that
 * depended on knowing it would not be a fix.
 *
 * `if: always()` was added so a **failed or cancelled** shard still reaches
 * this job. It does nothing about a shard that never concludes, because
 * `needs.<job>.result` collapses a whole matrix into one word and that word
 * was `success`.
 *
 * ## What this does instead
 *
 * The rollup is still read first, so a failed or a cancelled shard produces
 * exactly the diagnostic it produces today. Then the job counts the markers
 * the shards wrote **about themselves** — one tiny artifact per matrix leg,
 * uploaded by the leg as its last step — and refuses unless there is one per
 * declared shard and every one of them says `success`. The printed count is
 * the measured one, never the generated one: a sentence that says "4" because
 * the generator wrote "4" is the thing that lied on `39799846607`.
 *
 * Every reading that cannot be taken is a refusal. No marker directory, a
 * missing marker, an unreadable marker, a malformed count — all exit
 * non-zero, because UNMEASURED is not a pass.
 *
 * ## Why not the Actions API (#1190)
 *
 * #1189 answered the same question with `gh api …/jobs`, which worked and
 * cost every consumer two things the generated `test` job never needed
 * before: **`gh` on the runner image**, which is a GitHub-hosted-image fact
 * and not a runner fact — a self-hosted or container `runs-on`, which
 * `ci.runner` lets a consumer choose, has no `gh` — and **`actions: read` on
 * the job's token**. A marker needs neither. The runner reaches the artifact
 * service for the run it is already in, so upload and same-run download take
 * no `permissions:` scope and no token at all (`actions/download-artifact`'s
 * README: a `github-token` and `actions: read` are "required when downloading
 * artifacts from a different repository or from a different workflow run").
 *
 * A marker is also strictly better evidence than a conclusion. The API says
 * what GitHub recorded about a job; a marker is a file the job's own shell
 * wrote, so a leg that was created and then never executed leaves nothing
 * behind — which is exactly `39799846607`'s three queued shards.
 *
 * And the poll is gone with it. It existed for API propagation lag; a marker
 * uploaded before the leg concluded is downloadable the moment `needs` lets
 * this job start, so there is no lag to wait out and no `SHARD_POLL_*` knob
 * to surface in config.

/**
 * The steps one matrix leg runs to leave evidence that it executed (#1190).
 *
 * Two steps rather than one: a shell step writes the file, and
 * `actions/upload-artifact` carries it to the one place a sibling job can
 * read. Both are `if: always()`, because a leg that FAILED still executed and
 * the aggregate distinguishes "ran and was red" from "never ran" — collapsing
 * those two is #1181.
 *
 * The artifact name carries the run attempt as well as the matrix index, and
 * so does the marker's BODY. Two independent bindings, because a name is a
 * convention the generator controls and a body is a reading: a generator that
 * templated the wrong expression into the name would still be caught. The
 * attempt is there because artifacts are scoped to the run — see
 * `SHARD_MARKER_ARTIFACT_PREFIX` for the run this was measured on.
 *
 * The attempt in the name also removes the need for `overwrite`, which the
 * first draft of #1190 carried: names are now unique per attempt, so a
 * re-running leg collides with nothing and no deletion primitive is needed.
 *
 * `path:` names a single FILE, not the directory. A directory upload plus the
 * aggregate's `merge-multiple` flatten would discard the name's binding on
 * the reading side — a leg that wrote `shard-1`, `shard-2`, `shard-3` into
 * its own temp directory would contribute evidence for legs it is not, and
 * "each leg produced its own marker" would not be what the check measures.
 * Measured on run 39836500284: the leg writes a decoy `shard-99` and the
 * artifact carries only `shard-<its own index>`.
 *
 * The directory is created FRESH each run, so nothing an earlier step left
 * behind can ship as evidence.
 *
 * `if-no-files-found: error` because a marker step that produced no file is a
 * shard whose evidence is UNMEASURED, and the honest place to say so is in
 * the leg that failed to write it.

 * another run in the SAME group, so a key that is unique per main commit makes
 * the question moot — there is never a second occupant to do the cancelling.
 *
 * #937 tried the other arrangement: a ref-keyed group with
 * `cancel-in-progress: ${{ github.event_name == 'pull_request' }}`. It does not
 * work. Measured on this repository's own main after it shipped (#952): three
 * push runs cancelled inside eight minutes with that expression in the file,
 * one of them one second after the next run was created, and every cancelled
 * run had job count 0 — cancellation at queue time. The mechanism is
 * UNMEASURED; the leading hypothesis is that the result coerces to the
 * non-empty string "false", which is truthy. This form does not depend on
 * knowing which, and that is the point of choosing it.
 *
 * The three events:
 *
 *   - A pull request's ref is `refs/pull/<n>/merge`, unique to that PR, so a
 *     new push to PR #5 can only ever cancel PR #5. Superseding it is the
 *     point: the older commit's result is about code nobody will merge.
 *
 *   - A push to main shares ONE ref with every other push to main. Two merges
 *     landing within a few minutes cancel the first, and the first is the only
 *     run that ever builds that commit — a gap in main's history with no red
 *     check anywhere to say so. Measured on one consumer: five cancelled runs,
 *     all of them main pushes, and the `test` job runs on main push there, so
 *     what was lost was a test result and not just a container build. The repo
 *     and the run IDs are on #937 — the harness does not name its consumers
 *     (#304), and `test/anti.test.ts` SC-A1 is the check that says so.
 *
 *   - `merge_group` must not be cancelled either. A queue entry builds its own
 *     `gh-readonly-queue/...` ref, so it is already alone in its group, and
 *     cancelling one mid-flight dequeues the PR behind it.
 *
 * So: a push keys on `github.sha`, unique per commit and therefore never
 * shared. Everything else keys on `github.ref`, which is unique per pull
 * request and per queue entry but STABLE across pushes to the same PR — which
 * is what lets a PR supersede itself, the one case where cancelling is right.
 *
 * This is a SUB-KEY merge under `mergeManagedWorkflow`: a consumer that already
 * declares `cancel-in-progress` keeps its own value, and this reaches only the
 * consumers that have no concurrency block at all.
 */
/**
 * The `on.pull_request` trigger, carrying NO `branches:` filter — the one
 * shared binding every generated workflow renders (#1136).
 *
 * The filter used to be the same `branchList` emitted under `on.push`, which
 * made a pull request whose BASE was a feature branch match nothing and
 * trigger nothing: no `test`, no shards, no `gates`, no `ai-review`. Measured
 * on this repository before the change, by full 40-char head SHA — a short SHA
 * silently returns zero runs, so the two look identical and the query must use
 * the full one:
 *
 *   witness  #1128  base feat/713-migrate-product-hooks   0 runs
 *   witness  #1133  base feat/713-migrate-product-hooks   0 runs
 *   control  #1125  base main                             3 runs
 *   control  #1134  base main                             3 runs
 *
 * Base branch is the only input that differs. Both witnesses merged: with no
 * workflow triggered there is no required check left pending, so a pull
 * request that measured NOTHING is reported to the merge box exactly as a
 * green one is. That is the half worth naming — the gap is invisible from the
 * side that acts on it.
 *
 * `on.push` KEEPS its filter, and that is not an oversight. The two keys
 * answer different questions: `push.branches` is "which branches earn a CI run
 * on their own", `pull_request.branches` was answering "which bases may be
 * merged into", which nothing here ever wanted to ask. Deleting `branchList`
 * from both — the cheapest wrong fix, and it does turn every witness above
 * green — fires a full CI run on every push to every feature branch on top of
 * the `pull_request` run already covering that commit. Sampled over 25 recent
 * merged PRs: 44 commits, mean 1.76 pushes each, against 72 push-event runs in
 * the last 300. Roughly an order of magnitude of duplicated runner time for no
 * new coverage. The `on.push` cases in test/stacked-pr-ci-trigger.test.ts are
 * the control that stays red for it.
 *
 * Enumerating the namespaces instead (`feat/**`, `fix/**`) would have covered
 * all 6 of the non-`main`-based PRs in the last 200, so history cannot falsify
 * it. The prospective count can: of those 200, 24 head branches sit outside
 * both namespaces — `chore/`, `rg/`, `wt/`, `docs/`, `revert/`, bare names —
 * and any of them can be a base tomorrow. An allowlist re-creates this exact
 * defect the first time someone picks a prefix nobody enumerated, and does it
 * silently, which is the property that made #1136 cost two merges.

  // #630. The ai-review job, and the one property that makes it a check
  // rather than a decoration: there is NO `if:` here, at job level or step
  // level. A job skipped by `if:` reports `skipped`, and a skipped required
  // check can be treated as satisfied — a green required check for a review
  // that never ran. `secrets` is unavailable in `if:` at any level anyway, so
  // the mode is resolved inside `run:`, where it can emit an annotation and
  // choose an exit code. The step text is `buildAuthDetectStep()`'s verbatim,
  // not a copy: one decider for the script, and a mutation of it has one
  // binding. See lib/scaffold/ai-review-step.ts.
  //
  // `pull_request` and `merge_group`, and NOT `push`. A review of a pull
  // request has nothing to say about a push to a branch, and a trigger that
  // fires where the job cannot do its work is a run whose outcome means
  // nothing.
  //
  // `merge_group` is the exception to that sentence, and #867 is why it had to
  // be. This job was `pull_request`-only on exactly the reasoning above: a
  // merge group has no pull request, so the review would be vacuous. True, and
  // the wrong conclusion — it is an argument about what the job can DO on the
  // event, and it was applied to whether the job REPORTS on it. A consumer
  // makes `ai-review` a required context precisely because it is the check
  // that reads the code; a required context that never reports does not fail
  // the queue, it HANGS it, with every entry pending and nothing red anywhere.
  //
  // So the trigger is here and the vacuousness is handled where it belongs, in
  // the report step, which exits 0 on this event and says in a notice that no
  // review ran and why. That is sound rather than a green check for nothing: a
  // pull request cannot enter a merge queue without first satisfying its
  // required checks, so `ai-review` has already run on that exact head commit.
  //
  // No `branches:` filter, for the reason ci.yml states at length: the queue
  // builds a `gh-readonly-queue/<base>/...` ref that no branch list matches,
  // so a filtered trigger is an absent one that reads as handled.
  // #631. Workload Identity Federation, read from the consumer's own config.
  // One reading, taken here and threaded into both the permission block and
  // the steps — a second `vertexCiConfig(...)` call beside either would be a
  // decider that always agrees with this one and could never be told apart
  // from it (`.claude/rules/checks-must-be-able-to-fail.md`, fourth shape).
  const vertex = vertexCiConfig(harness?.ci);

  // `id-token: write` is what lets the runner mint the OIDC token GCP's STS
  // exchanges. Granted ONLY when there is a federation to use it, because a
  // permission nobody consumes is a permission nobody audits.
  //
  // `actions: read` is #1168's, and it is granted unconditionally because
  // the round counter it serves runs on every review. It is READ on the
  // workflow's own run list and nothing else: the step lifts one integer,
  // `total_count`, which is how many times this workflow has run on this
  // pull request — the only thing in reach that is actually a review round.
  // A permission nobody consumes is a permission nobody audits, and this one
  // has exactly one consumer, named in `buildRoundsScript`.
  //
  // LAST in the block, after `id-token: write`, and the order is not
  // cosmetic. This file is job-preserving: a consumer who already has the
  // workflow gets the new key MERGED into their existing permissions block,
  // which appends. A generator emitting it in the middle therefore disagrees
  // with what every already-scaffolded tree ends up holding, and AC-12 in
  // test/ai-review-surface-census.test.ts compares the committed file
  // against a FRESH generation — so the two orders are a byte difference
  // that reads as a hand-edit. Measured: that is exactly how this was found.
  // `pull-requests: write` is #1168's second half: the findings ledger is an
  // upserted pull-request comment, and nothing else in this job writes one.
  //
  // It is APPENDED after `actions: read` for the merge reason above, and it
  // is the narrowest grant that can write a comment — `issues: write` would
  // also work and would additionally let this job edit issues, which it has
  // no reason to touch.
  //
  // On a FORK pull request GitHub hands this job a read-only token whatever
  // is written here, so the grant is inert exactly where the checked-out code

/**
 * The commands Claude Code would actually RUN for one event, read the way
 * Claude Code reads them (#1088).
 *
 * The schema is `event → matcher group → hooks[] → { type, command }`, and a
 * leaf is a registration only when every level is present:
 *
 * ```json
 * "PreToolUse": [
 *   { "matcher": "Bash", "hooks": [ { "type": "command", "command": "…" } ] }
 * ]
 * ```
 *
 * `matcher` is omitted for events that do not have one — `SessionStart`,
 * `SubagentStop`, `PostCompact` and the rest — but `hooks[]` and
 * `type: "command"` are not optional anywhere. Read off a live
 * `~/.claude/settings.json` holding twenty-five groups across eleven events,
 * not off documentation.
 *
 * ## Why this is not `settingsCommands` from `lib/hook-trees.ts`
 *
 * That function walks the document recursively and collects any `command`
 * string **at any depth**, deliberately: it answers a census question —
 * *which trees does this machine register hooks from* — and a census that
 * knew one shape would report a document in the next shape as empty, which
 * is indistinguishable from a machine with no registrations.
 *
 * That tolerance is exactly why #1088 survived. `deployHooksToConsumers`
 * wrote a bare `{ command }` straight into the event array; the permissive
 * walk found the string, every test that asked "is the hook there?" said yes,
 * and Claude Code — the only reader whose answer decides whether the guard
 * runs — saw an array element it does not recognise as a hook. Two readers
 * disagreed and the authoritative one was not under test.
 *
 * So this reader is **strict on purpose**, and it is a second binding on
 * purpose. The two answer different questions and must be able to disagree:
 * their disagreement on a bare `{ command }` is the whole defect, and a
 * reading that cannot disagree cannot witness it
 * (`.claude/rules/checks-must-be-able-to-fail.md`, fourth shape).

/**
 * Deploy hooks marked deployToConsumers:true to consumer projects'
 * .claude/settings.local.json with correct hookFor and command paths.
 * SC-472: scaffold deploys consumer-facing hooks
 *
 * Reads through the config loader, so the hooks come from
 * `.claude/rungate/hooks.json` under the directory layout and from
 * `.claude/rungate.json` under the monolith. Reading the monolith path
 * directly — as this did — meant a project on the directory layout deployed
 * nothing and said nothing, because the early return is indistinguishable
 * from "this project has no hooks" (#70).
 *
 * ## Every exit leaves a reading (#1047)
 *
 * #70 fixed one silent return and left four. When #1047 was written, zero of
 * twenty registry entries set `deployToConsumers`, so the eligible set was
 * empty on every run this function had ever had, and the only line it emitted
 * was `SKIP: All hooks already deployed to <consumer>` — a claim about hooks
 * that were never eligible, printed by the `else` of `deployed > 0`. A caller
 * reading the action list saw a successful no-op. So did the release.
 *
 * **That count is no longer true, and this docblock asserted it for longer
 * than it held.** Re-measured 2026-10-21 by parsing
 * `.claude/rungate/hooks.json`: **twenty entries, twelve `true`, eight
 * `false`, none absent.** #1047's AC-11 now refuses an entry that leaves the
 * field unset, which is why nothing is absent and why the number cannot drift
 * back. Corrected by #713, which found the same stale claim in two other
 * places; if you are reading this docblock you are most likely the person
 * about to decide what a consumer receives, and the old sentence told you
 * nobody had opted in when twelve entries had.
 *
 * What that does and does not mean, since the eligible set being non-empty is
 * the whole precondition for everything below:
 *
 * - Deployment is **armed**, not dormant. `hooks/` is in `package.json`'s
 *   `files[]`, so the `node_modules/<pkg>/hooks` command this function writes
 *   resolves on a consumer.
 * - **Publishing deploys nothing by itself.** This function runs from the
 *   scaffold's write-steps, not from an install hook, so the trigger is a
 *   scaffold run and the sink is `<consumerRoot>/.claude/settings.local.json`.
 * - **`consumers` is `[]` on this repository today**, so the guard below
 *   returns before any of that. The first declared consumer to be scaffolded
 *   is when twelve hook registrations first appear in somebody's settings.
 *
 * Four outcomes used to arrive as one, or as nothing:
 *
 * | what happened | what it said before | what it says now |
 * |---|---|---|
 * | no rungate config at all | nothing | `SKIP:` naming the root |
 * | config has no `hooks` array | nothing | `SKIP:` naming the absence |
 * | no `consumers` declared | nothing | `SKIP:` naming the absence |
 * | hooks exist, none opted in | `SKIP: All hooks already deployed` | `UNMEASURED:` with the count |
 * | all eligible already present | `SKIP: All hooks already deployed` | `SKIP:` with the eligible count |
 *
 * The UNMEASURED row is the one the issue turns on. `0 deployed because the
 * project wanted none` and `0 deployed because nobody set the flag` are
 * different facts and only one of them is fine; the first is now a `SKIP`
 * over a non-empty eligible set and the second is an `UNMEASURED` that names
 * how many entries were read and how many opted in. `.claude/rules/
 * config-access.md`: a reading is not `0`, `{}`, `null` or silence.
 *
 * A DEPLOYED line also names the hooks, because a count cannot be checked
 * against a registry and a list can.

/**
 * ## The generated pre-commit hook, as one binding (#610)
 *
 * ## What was wrong
 *
 * The hook decided WHICH updater to run by sniffing the working tree at
 * commit time:
 *
 *     updater=""
 *     if [ -f "scripts/update-project-state.ts" ]; then
 *       updater="scripts/update-project-state.ts"
 *     elif [ -f "node_modules/rungate/scripts/update-project-state.ts" ]; then
 *       updater="node_modules/rungate/scripts/update-project-state.ts"
 *     fi
 *
 * and the comment above it said the order was deliberate because "a checkout
 * that has its own scripts/ copy is the harness". That is an identity
 * inferred from a FILENAME. "This tree holds a file at this path" and "this
 * tree is the rungate harness" are different facts, and the hook treated the
 * first as proof of the second — so a consumer that keeps a script at that
 * path for its own reasons was silently reclassified as the harness and ran a
 * different program than the one rungate installed. Nothing in the commit
 * recorded which branch fired, so the two outcomes were indistinguishable
 * afterwards.
 *
 * A detector narrower than what it detects
 * (`.claude/rules/checks-must-be-able-to-fail.md`, second shape), with the
 * *Silent Default Substitution* that `.claude/rules/config-access.md` refuses
 * sitting underneath it.
 *
 * ## What it does instead
 *
 * The decision is taken HERE, at generation time, and one concrete path is
 * baked into the emitted script. The hook names the program it runs; a tree
 * that acquires a same-named file afterwards cannot change what executes.
 *
 * Identity is read from the project's own declaration — `isHarnessItself`,
 * which reads `package.json`'s `name` and is the single existing binding for
 * this question in the tree (#380). It is deliberately NOT a second reading
 * of the same fact: two deciders that agree are behaviourally one, and no
 * mutation of either could tell them apart.
 *
 * ## Three readings, and UNMEASURED is one of them
 *
 * | the tree declares | the candidate | emitted |
 * |---|---|---|
 * | `name: "rungate"` | `scripts/update-project-state.ts` | that path, baked |
 * | anything else | `node_modules/rungate/scripts/…` | that path, baked |
 * | either, candidate absent | — | UNMEASURED, and no lookup at all |
 *
 * The third row is the one that must not be a guess. A hook carrying a
 * lookup "in case the file turns up later" succeeds at some unknown future
 * commit for a reason nobody chose, and `0`, `""`, `null` and a
 * plausible-looking path are all indistinguishable from success.

# project-state.json, PROJECT-STATE.md and SUCCESS.md are DA-owned: a single
# shared state document that several worktrees must not each write their own
# version of (#296). The rule is written down in CLAUDE.md and in
# .claude/rules/key-files.md, and this hook used to do the opposite of it on
# every commit in every worktree — so an agent that obeyed the rule perfectly
# still shipped the violation, because the staging happened after it had
# decided not to touch the file. A rule something actively undoes is worse
# than a rule nothing executes.
#
# The hook cannot tell whether it is the DA. It CAN tell whether it is in a
# linked worktree: --git-dir points at .git/worktrees/<name> there while
# --git-common-dir points at the shared .git, and in the primary checkout the
# two are the same answer.
#
# The first draft resolved both through a cd-then-pwd-P round trip first, on
# the theory that one could come back relative and the other absolute. The
# mutation battery scored that normalisation 0 of 20 — both arms behave
# identically without it, executed against a real primary checkout and a real
# linked worktree. An unmeasured guard is indistinguishable from an absent
# one, so it is absent. git hooks run from the toplevel, and both calls share
# a cwd, so there was never a case that needed it.
#
# The primary arm had three fail-opens in two lines (#599), and the shape is
# this file's recurring one: a check that passed because of what it never
# looked at. The path was the CONSUMER layout, so in the harness's own
# checkout — which has scripts/update-project-state.ts and no
# node_modules/rungate at all — bun exited non-zero on a file that is not
# there. 2>/dev/null threw the ENOENT away, || true threw the status away, and
# the git add below then staged whatever happened to be on disk.
#

# command's answer, and a decline, a reading and an updater's progress are all
# diagnosis rather than output.

 *
 * ## Why the MINOR floor and not the current patch
 *
 * A caret on the exact current version — `^0.2.2` from a tree at 0.2.2 —
 * cannot resolve until that version is published, and this repo runs ahead
 * of npm (0.2.1 published against 0.2.2 in the tree when this was written;
 * #364 is about there being no release workflow at all). A consumer
 * scaffolded in that window would get an unresolvable dependency, which is
 * the same defect in a new costume.
 *
 * `^0.2.0` is satisfied by every published 0.2.x, so it resolves to the
 * newest one available today AND picks up the next release with no
 * re-scaffold. The floor moves when the harness's own minor moves, which is

 * `.claude/rules/checks-must-be-able-to-fail.md` on assertions that hold
 * vacuously. `test/scaffold-audit-agreement.test.ts` pins both directions.
 *
 * **The verb list had drifted from the verbs scaffold emits, and #398's
 * agreement check is what found it.** `REGENERATED`, `REFRESHED` and
 * `REPAIRED` are all writes and none of them was here, so for as long as they
 * have existed `postScaffoldCommit --commit` has quietly failed to stage
 * `AGENTS.md` (REGENERATED, `write-steps.ts`), `.claude/rules/` (REFRESHED,
 * `steps.ts:611`) and any seeded config (REPAIRED, `steps.ts:1181`). The
 * comment above this list used to say missing a verb "silently leaves
 * generated files uncommitted", which was exactly right and exactly what was
 * happening.
 *
 * A prose warning did not keep the list current, so there is now a test that
 * greps the sources for emitted write verbs and fails when one is not here.

 * planted repositories: **all 56 of an audit's report lines were
 * byte-identical to the lines `--fix` printed for the same work.** So

 * four times and filed a missing-write bug off it. The report never lied;
 * its unit of qualification was wider than its unit of consumption.
 *

 * default substitution (`.claude/rules/config-access.md`): a future call site
 * that forgets to say which mode it is in would print unqualified lines and
