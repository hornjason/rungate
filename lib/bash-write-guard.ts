/**
 * The decision behind `hooks/BashWriteGuard.hook.ts` (#473 on
 * `hornjason/pai-config`, tuned there in #474, reworked in #1120).
 *
 * Extracted from the hook so the population it refuses can be MEASURED
 * rather than argued about: 5,060 real commands from this machine's
 * transcripts were run through it, which is not something you can do with a
 * decision that only exists inside a subprocess. Same shape as
 * `lib/gate-result-protection.ts`, which #1137 extracted for the same reason.
 *
 * ## The thing this module exists to get right
 *
 * One mechanism was failing in BOTH directions at once.
 *
 * It UNDER-blocked, because a read-only prefix allowlist was consulted before
 * anything looked at what the command wrote, so `gh --version; echo x >
 * .gate-salt` exited clean. A prefix says nothing about what follows a `;`.
 *
 * It OVER-blocked, because the remaining checks matched protected names
 * anywhere in the command STRING, so a read-only `git show … | grep -nE
 * "chmod|chflags"` was refused for quoting the words it was searching for.
 * That happened four times in real work — twice to the session coordinating
 * this fix, twice to a peer staging a comparison copy — and a guard that
 * makes reading its own source awkward is a guard people route around.
 *
 * Both directions are the same root cause: a substring test over a whole
 * command line cannot tell CODE from DATA. So nothing here tests the whole
 * string. The command is split into segments at top-level separators, and
 * each check asks a structural question of a segment:
 *
 *   - what does this segment WRITE?          → redirects, tee, cp/mv
 *   - what does this segment MUTATE in place? → sed -i, dd of=, rm, …
 *   - is this segment OPAQUE?                 → an interpreter body, find -exec
 *   - is this segment's COMMAND WORD chmod?   → not "does it contain chmod"
 *
 * Quotes are handled two different ways on purpose, and the distinction is
 * the whole fix:
 *
 *   `stripQuoted`  deletes quoted spans INCLUDING their contents. Used to
 *                  find a VERB, because text inside quotes is an argument,
 *                  never the command the shell runs. This is what stops a
 *                  grep PATTERN from reading as a chmod invocation.
 *   `dequote`      removes quote characters and KEEPS the contents. Used to
 *                  find a TARGET, because `chmod 777 "x.hook.ts"` really does
 *                  name a hook file.
 *
 * Using `stripQuoted` for both would let an attacker quote the path; using
 * `dequote` for both reinstates all four false positives. Each test below
 * names which one it uses and why.
 *
 * ## The names are global; the artifacts are not (#1175)
 *
 * `PROTECTED_FILES` is a list of NAMES, and until #1175 a name matched in any
 * tree. A fixture at `/tmp/rg-abc/workflow-state.json` was refused as readily
 * as a live run's state, which is a true positive against the rule and a false
 * positive against intent — agents on this repo build such fixtures
 * constantly, including fixtures for this module.
 *
 * The scoping is by SCRATCH TREE rather than by project root, and that is a
 * measurement and not a preference. #1175's acceptance asked for "the path
 * relative to the project root". Swept over 5,531 real commands, the gate
 * artifacts named in them resolve like this:
 *
 *     2,620  under the run store (`$RUNGATE_WORK_DIR`, i.e. `~/.rungate`)
 *       521  under a former run store (`~/.pai-work`) or `~/.claude`
 *     1,724  no resolvable path at all — a bare basename, or built by `join`
 *        83  under an OS temp root
 *        65  relative
 *        16  under a repository tree
 *
 * A live `workflow-state.json` is almost never inside the project root: it is
 * in the run store, one level up and sideways. "Protect what is under the
 * root" would therefore have stopped protecting 3,141 of 3,240 absolute
 * references — reopening `pai-config#473` C1, the forge-a-gate-result attack
 * this guard was built for. The root-relative reading is recorded here as
 * MEASURED WRONG rather than merely not chosen.
 *
 * So the question asked is the fail-closed one: can this path be shown to be
 * in a scratch tree? Only then is it a fixture. Every other answer —
 * elsewhere, relative, or not a path at all — keeps the old refusal. An
 * allowlist is normally the wrong shape here and `pai-config#474`'s
 * read-only-prefix list is why: a PREFIX says nothing about what a command
 * writes. A scratch root says something about the DESTINATION, is consulted
 * only after the destination has been extracted, and is not a judgement call
 * — each entry is a value `mktemp -d` returns on a supported platform.
 * Narrowing it over-blocks; it cannot open a hole.

 * The trees an OS temporary directory can be in.
 *
 * `/tmp` and `/private/tmp` are both listed because on macOS they are the
 * same directory under two names and a command may spell either; `resolve()`
 * normalises `..` but does not follow links, and the link cannot be followed
 * here because the path being judged usually does not exist yet — it is about
 * to be created. `/var/folders` is where macOS puts a per-user `$TMPDIR`, and
 * `tmpdir()` covers whatever the platform or the environment says, which is
 * what `mkdtemp`, `mkstemp` and `mktemp -d` all build on.
 *
 * Each root is also recorded in its REALPATH form. On macOS `/var` is a
 * symlink to `/private/var`, so `tmpdir()` hands back `/var/folders/…/T`
 * while the resolution below hands back `/private/var/folders/…/T`, and a
 * list holding only the first form answers `false` for every path spelled
 * the way `mkdtemp` hands it to a program.
 *
 * The corpus does NOT show this, and saying so is the point: real commands
 * spell `/tmp` literally, so all 37 fixture commands clear either way. It
 * was found by `isScratchPath, asserted directly` calling `tmpdir()`, which
 * is what a program does and what a person does not. A sweep over what
 * people typed cannot see a defect in what their programs compute.
 *
 * Read at call time rather than frozen at import, because `TMPDIR` is what a
 * test harness moves when it wants its own scratch space, and a guard that
 * cached the old value would refuse the new one.
 *
 * ## `TMPDIR` is the writer's variable, so it is not trusted
 *
 * The first version of this took `process.env.TMPDIR` as given. Measured:
 *
 *     TMPDIR unset                  isScratchPath(…/.rungate/x/…) = false
 *     TMPDIR=$HOME/.rungate                                       = true
 *
 * The agent whose write is being judged sets the variable that decides
 * whether the write is exempt, and pointing it at the run store switches the
 * guard off for the one directory it exists to protect. `tmpdir()` is the
 * same hole wearing a function call — on POSIX it READS `TMPDIR`.
 *
 * So `FIXED` is the whole of the trust, and the environment can only ever
 * SELECT within it: a `TMPDIR` that does not already resolve inside a fixed
 * root is dropped. A platform whose temp directory is somewhere else
 * over-blocks, which is the direction this module is allowed to be wrong in.

/**
 * Trees that hold LIVE artifacts, wherever on the disk they are.
 *
 * This is SUBTRACTED from the exemption in `isScratchPath`, not merely used
 * to vet the root list. The difference matters: vetting roots is a proxy for
 * the property, and it only holds for roots somebody thought of. Subtracting
 * the trees themselves IS the property — "a live artifact is never exempt" —
 * and it keeps holding when a root is added later by someone who has not
 * read this comment.
 *
 * The two mechanisms are also not interchangeable, and conflating them was
 * measured. Dropping a ROOT because it contains a protected tree removes
 * `/tmp` wholesale the moment `RUNGATE_WORK_DIR` points inside it — which a
 * real corpus command does — and refuses every fixture on the machine.
 * Subtracting the TREE removes only that subtree and leaves the rest of
 * `/tmp` exempt. So the root list is vetted only against trees that are not
 * themselves scratch, and the subtraction below applies unconditionally.
 *
 * ## The hook directories are here because a checkout CAN be the live hook
 *
 * A review argued that `PROTECTED_HOOKS` should lose the scratch exemption
 * entirely, on the grounds that a `.hook.ts` under `/tmp` is as likely to be
 * a real checkout as a fixture — worktrees under `/tmp` are routine here.
 * The counter-argument offered was that a hook source in a checkout is not
 * the live hook, so compromising one does nothing until it is deployed.
 *
 * That counter-argument is FALSE on this machine, and `lib/hook-target-tree.ts`
 * is where it was measured: every registration in `~/.claude/settings.json`
 * is spelled `${PAI_HOOKS_DIR}/…` or `${RUNGATE_HOOKS_DIR}/…`, and
 * `RUNGATE_HOOKS_DIR` resolved to *a checkout that is not this one*, with
 * fourteen hooks executing from it. #999's shell-injection fix never reached
 * the bytes that run. A checkout is the live hook exactly when a variable
 * says it is.
 *
 * So the answer is neither "refuse the exemption for hooks" nor "trust the
 * checkout": resolve where the registrations actually point and subtract
 * THAT, wherever it is — including when it is under `/tmp`. A hook in a
 * worktree nothing registers stays a fixture, which is the case #1175 exists
 * for; a hook in the tree that is actually wired stays protected, which is
 * the case the review was worried about.
 *
 * `process.cwd()` is deliberately NOT here, and the reason is measured. A
 * checkout under `/tmp` is ordinary on this machine — the worktree this was
 * written in is `/private/tmp/rg-1175-wt` — so treating the working
 * directory as protected drops `/private/tmp` from the roots, and because
 * `/tmp` realpaths to it the walk then refuses every `/tmp` path as well.
 * 12 of 145 tests red, measured.
 *
 * ## BOTH spellings, which #1175 got wrong
 *
 * `resolve()` normalises `.` and `..`; it does not follow a symlink. So a
 * tree named `/tmp/e2e` stayed in this list as `/tmp/e2e` while a path
 * through the same inode reads `/private/tmp/e2e/…`, and `inAnyTree`
 * matches neither spelling against the other. Executed against the module
 * as merged, with `RUNGATE_WORK_DIR=/tmp/e2e`:
 *
 *     /tmp/e2e/s/workflow-state.json           blocked
 *     /private/tmp/e2e/s/workflow-state.json   ALLOWED   ← the run store
 *
 * The same for `RUNGATE_HOOKS_DIR`, and `/tmp` is a symlink to
 * `/private/tmp` on every macOS install, so the second spelling is not
 * exotic — it is what `realpath` prints.
 *
 * `scratchRoots()` below already recorded both spellings for the fixed
 * roots, so the asymmetry was inside one file: the roots a write may land
 * in were realpathed and the trees it may not were not. A `catch` here
 * means the tree is not on disk, which is ordinary for a variable pointing
 * at a directory the command is about to create, and the resolved spelling
 * stands on its own.

 * bypass, not a race — no second actor is required.
 *
 * `mkdir -p` is the overwhelmingly common thing a fixture does to a path that
 * does not exist yet, and a directory cannot point out of its tree. Only a

 * commands this branch clears create one, and 9 commands in the whole 5,550
 * corpus match at all.
 *
 * ## The verb is resolved, not pattern-matched
 *
 * The first version tested `/(?:^|[\s;&|(])ln\s/` against the raw command,
 * which requires whitespace or a separator immediately before `ln`. Measured:
 * `ln -s`, `sudo ln` and `find -exec ln` voided, but **`/bin/ln -s … /tmp/x`
 * and `\ln -s … /tmp/x` did not** — two spellings the shell resolves
 * identically to the one that did, walking past the control the whole
 * exemption rests on.
 *
 * `commandWord` already strips a leading path and a leading `\` or `(`, and
 * already skips `sudo`, `env`, `xargs` and the other wrappers, because
 * #1120 and #1184 taught it to. Running it per segment is one tokeniser
 * instead of two and gets all of that for free, so the segment's resolved
 * VERB is the primary test.
 *
 * `LINK_CREATION` stays as a second, broader net for the positions a command
 * word cannot reach: `find . -exec ln …` resolves to `find`, and
 * `symlinkSync` lives inside an interpreter body this module does not parse.
 * It is read off the raw command for that reason — the link and the write
 * are in different segments by construction.

/**
 * `ln` is not the only verb that makes a link (#1411, raised as a CRITICAL
 * by the review on #1354).
 *
 * GNU and BSD `cp` create links on request and spell none of
 * `LINK_CREATION`'s four alternatives, so every one of these was ALLOWED —
 * the bypass in the docblock above, reachable by a different verb:
 *
 *     cp -s ~/.rungate/victim /tmp/esc && echo '{}' > /tmp/esc/workflow-state.json
 *
 * Measured before the fix, all allowed: `cp -s`, `cp --symbolic-link`,
 * `cp -l`, `cp --link`, `cp -rs`, `cp -as`, `cp -sv`, `/bin/cp -s`,
 * `sudo cp -s`, `install -l s`. `-l` belongs with `-s`: a hard link to a
 * file inside the run store aims a later write at the victim's inode just
 * as a symlink aims it at the victim's path.
 *
 * ## The FAMILY, not the spelling
 *
 * A test for the literal `cp -s` is the cheapest wrong fix — seven of the
 * ten rows above walk around it. So the reading is token-level: a short
 * cluster is any `-…` containing a lower-case `s` or `l`, which is what
 * makes `-rs`, `-as` and `-sv` fall out of one rule rather than three; a
 * long option is matched by PREFIX, because GNU accepts any unambiguous
 * abbreviation and `--sym` is as real as `--symbolic-link`.
 *
 * Case matters: `cp -L` dereferences links in the SOURCE and creates none,
 * so only the lower-case letters count. `cp -r`, `cp -p`, `cp -a` and
 * `mkdir -p` are CONTROL rows and must stay exempt.
 *
 * The scan is position-independent rather than keyed to the resolved verb,
 * so `find . -exec cp -s …` is covered — the same position `LINK_CREATION`
 * exists to reach for `ln`, where `commandWord` resolves to `find`.
 *
 * ## And the `ln` boundary, since it was asked
 *
 * `\bln\s` needs a following character, so it misses an `ln` that ends a
 * segment. Measured over five spellings: the regex misses four, and the
 * segment-verb net catches three of those four (`ln`, `echo x && ln`,
 * `sudo ln`). The one neither catches is `find . -exec ln` with no
 * terminator, which `find(1)` refuses — "the expression must be terminated
 * by a semicolon" — so it is a syntax error, not a bypass. Count: ONE
 * spelling missed by both nets, ZERO executable. No change made.
 *
 * ## The FOUR transforms a shell applies before `cp` sees a flag
 *
 * Every bypass found in this family so far has been the same question asked
 * about a different transform, and each was rediscovered separately because
 * nothing wrote the list down. There are three, and a reading of a token is
 * only correct if it survives all of them:
 *
 * | transform | what the shell does | where this module does it |
 * |---|---|---|
 * | quote removal | `'-s'`, `"-s"`, `-'s'`, `c""p` all arrive bare | `readWord`, via `scanSegment` (#1429) |
 * | escape removal | `-\s`, `-r\s`, `-\-symbolic-link`, `--sy\mbolic-link` arrive as `-s`, `-rs`, `--symbolic-link` | `isLinkFlag`, before EITHER branch |
 * | substitution grouping | `` `…` `` and `$(…)` hand their text to ANOTHER shell, and `$(…)` nests | `nestedCommands` |
 * | ANSI-C quoting | `$'-s'` is the word `-s`, and `$'-\163'` is too | `readWord`, via `decodeAnsiC` |
 *
 * Measured against `/bin/bash` rather than assumed: `printf '[%s]' -\s -\l
 * -r\s -\-symbolic-link --sy\mbolic-link $'-s' $'-\163' $'cp'` prints
 * `[-s][-l][-rs][--symbolic-link][--symbolic-link][-s][-s][cp]`. Every one
 * of those was ALLOWED before its transform was read, as were
 * `` `cp -s …` ``, ``eval `cp -s …` ``, a `$(…)` containing a second
 * `$(…)`, and a `$(…)` wrapping a parenthesised subshell.
 *
 * The fourth arrived the way the second and third did — a review round
 * after the table said three — which is the argument for the table rather
 * than against it. If a fifth turns up, add the row. The point is that the
 * next reader checks all of them at once instead of finding them one review
 * at a time.
 *

 * #1239: both scanners below used to find the partner with `indexOf`, and

 * escaped quote was read as the closing one, every subsequent quote was
 * paired off by one, and the scanner ran off the end of the line — taking
 * the `>` operator with it. No operator, no target, ALLOW. Seven spellings
 * that bash runs and that overwrite the file reached a real write that way,
 * across both call sites; `test/bash-write-guard.test.ts` holds the table.
 *
 * The asymmetry is bash's and is the whole of the fix: a single-quoted span
 * takes NO escapes, so `'a\'` is a complete span whose contents are `a\`,
 * while in a double-quoted span `\` escapes whatever follows it.
 *
 * Unterminated spans run to `s.length` — the pre-existing, fail-closed
 * direction. Those spellings are syntax errors that bash refuses to run, so
 * nothing executable depends on the choice.
 *
 * ## #1471: `end` alone could not say which of those two happened
 *
 * This used to return a bare number, and for a span that closes at the very
 * LAST character of the string that number is `s.length` — the same value
 * an unterminated span returns. The one caller that strips the quotes
 * resolved the ambiguity with `end === s.length ? s.length : end - 1`, which
 * cannot be right: it takes the unterminated branch for a correctly closed
 * final word and keeps the closing quote inside the word.
 *
 * Measured on `5d0bf00e` before this fix, and **one trailing space is the
 * entire difference** — `segments()` trims it, so the spaced form is simply
 * the same command without a final-word quote:
 *
 *     cp /tmp/evil.hook.ts /repo/hooks/     → targets 2, BLOCKED
 *     cp /tmp/evil.hook.ts "/repo/hooks/"   → targets 1, ALLOWED
 *
 * The consequence is sharper than a cosmetic trailing quote. `/repo/hooks/"`
 * does not end with `/`, so `isDirDestination` reads a DIRECTORY as a plain
 * file, the `dest/basename(src)` expansion never happens, and the target
 * that would have named `.hook.ts` is never produced. That is #1184's H4
 * arriving through a new door.
 *
 * It is #1239's defect one level down: there, `indexOf` could not tell `"`
 * from `\"`; here, `s.length` could not tell *closed at the end* from
 * *never closed*. One value carrying two meanings — and
 * `.claude/rules/checks-must-be-able-to-fail.md` names the shape: *a status
 * code is almost never specific to one mechanism*.
 *
 * So the span reports BOTH boundaries and no caller recomputes either.
 * `contentEnd` is where the span's contents stop; `end` is where the next
 * word starts. For a terminated span they differ by the closing quote, and
 * for an unterminated one they are equal. The three callers read the field
 * they need and none of them owns a ternary — which is the point, because
 * a `terminated` flag computed at each call site would be three deciders
 * over one question, and that is how this family keeps coming back.
 *
 * One function, three callers, so a mutation of it moves all of them.

/**
 * ANSI-C quoting: the value of a `$'…'` word.
 *
 * Unlike `$(…)` and `` `…` ``, this is settled at parse time — no command
 * runs and nothing is looked up — so decoding it makes a word MORE readable
 * rather than guessing at one. `$'-\163'` is the string `-s` on every run.
 *
 * An escape this does not recognise keeps its backslash, which is what bash
 * does with one.
 *
 * ## Octal and `\x` are BYTES, so the decode assembles bytes
 *
 * Measured: `printf '%s' $'\303\251' | od -An -tx1` gives `c3 a9`, and so
 * do `$'\xc3\xa9'` and a literal `é` — all three are the UTF-8 encoding of
 * one character. A per-escape `String.fromCharCode` gives U+00C3 followed
 * by U+00A9, a different string of four bytes, so above 0x7F that spelling
 * hands the module a token the shell never produced. Same defect as the
 * transforms this function exists to close, pointing the other way.
 *
 * It is a live one, not a cosmetic differential. With a symlink named
 * `café` under a scratch root pointing into the run store, the write
 * through it is REFUSED when spelled literally and when spelled
 * `$'café'`, and was ALLOWED when spelled `$'caf\303\251'` or
 * `$'caf\xc3\xa9'` — the module looked for a directory nobody had made,
 * found nothing to resolve, and exempted it as ordinary scratch. That is
 * #1175's escape with a name the decoder disagreed about.
 *
 * So escapes are decoded into BYTES and the byte string is decoded as
 * UTF-8 once, at the end. Refusing to decode above 0x80 was the first
 * repair and it does NOT close this: an undecoded `caf\303\251` is just
 * another directory that does not exist, which is exempt. The conservative
 * answer and the wrong answer are the same answer here.
 *
 * `\u` and `\U` stay code points, because that is what bash defines them
 * as — it emits their UTF-8 encoding, which is what they mean once the
 * command text has itself been decoded from UTF-8.
 *
 * What remains: a byte sequence that is not valid UTF-8, such as a lone
 * `$'\303'`, becomes U+FFFD here and names a file this module cannot
 * spell. Closing that needs byte-level paths throughout, which is a
 * different change; the residue is one unmatched character in a position
 * that is then unprovable rather than wrongly exempt.

/**
 * Declared write intent inside an interpreter body.
 *
 * The honest version of this arm would refuse any interpreter naming a

 * MEASURED: it newly refused 1,760 of 5,060 real commands — 35% — and
 * triage found them to be reads. `bun -e '…readFileSync(…workflow-state
 * .json…)…'` and `python3 -I -c 'json.load(open(…))'` are how every agent
 * on this machine inspects gate state, and a guard that refuses the normal
 * way of looking at a thing is a guard that gets switched off.
 *
 * So the arm fires on a declared write VERB instead. The limit that buys is
 * real and is stated rather than hidden: an interpreter can always evade
 * this — build the name from pieces, `eval` it, call through a variable, or
 * put the program in a file instead of `-c`. This arm raises the cost of an
 * accidental write and of the obvious deliberate one. It is not a boundary,
 * and `.claude/rules/checks-must-be-able-to-fail.md` would call it a
 * detector narrower than what it detects. It is the widest setting the
 * measured false-positive rate allows.
 *
 * ## #1214: an imported project function is outside what this arm can decide
 *
 * The concession above says an interpreter can evade this arm by calling
 * through a variable or putting the program in a file. #1214 filed a case
 * needing neither — a plain call to a project function the enumeration has
 * never heard of:
 *
 *     bun -e "
 *     import {initWorkflow, writeACs} from '<harness>/gates/orchestrator.ts';
 *     const sf = '<run store>/workflow-state.json';
 *     initWorkflow(sf, {…});
 *     writeACs(sf, JSON.parse(process.argv[1]));"
 *
 * `initWorkflow` and `writeACs` both write `sf`, `sf` is a live run-store
 * artifact, and nothing in the list above matches. ALLOW.
 *
 * The issue's framing 1 — derive the suspicious-call set from the body's OWN
 * `import` statement, so the module enumerates nothing and stays
 * project-agnostic — was implemented and swept over 130,247 real commands
 * from this machine's 31,793 transcripts:
 *
 *     newly BLOCKED  616          newly ALLOWED  0
 *       600  call a writing orchestrator symbol  (writeWorkflowState 301,
 *            initWorkflow+writeACs 285, the rest in ones and twos)
 *        10  call a reading one (readWorkflow, loadWorkflow, …)
 *         6  probe this module or take a hook census
 *     0 of the 616 are scratch fixtures; every one names the live run store.
 *
 * 97% precision by that reading, and it is still **not shippable** — for a
 * reason no count could show. The 600 are not evasions. They are this
 * harness's own prescribed mechanism:
 *
 *   - `workflows/ship.js` EMITS the filed command, at the GOAL phase, under
 *     an instruction reading "Run this EXACTLY as written". The payload
 *     spelling `JSON.parse(process.argv[1])` is generated by
 *     `acPayloadReadExpression()` in `lib/evidence-command-transport.ts`, so
 *     the fingerprint belongs to the harness and to nothing else.
 *   - `gates/SCHEMA-GUIDE.md` prescribes `writeWorkflowState` via `bun -e`
 *     in place of the Write tool or `cat >`.
 *   - `lib/gate-result-protection.ts` and `lib/gate-enforcement.ts` PRINT
 *     that command to the agent as the sanctioned repair.
 *
 * So the predicate would refuse the GOAL phase of every run, and the guard
 * would be refusing the exact command its sibling modules hand out as the
 * remedy. The filed case and the sanctioned repair are the same operation,
 * differing only in which orchestrator symbol is called — and separating
 * them means enumerating one consumer's API, which is what #1214 forbids and
 * is wrong in every other tree besides.
 *
 * **The result is therefore framing 2, and it belongs here rather than in an
 * open issue: a program that imports project code is outside what a
 * command-line guard can decide.** Nothing read off the command line
 * distinguishes a sanctioned write from an unsanctioned one when both are
 * the same call to the same function on the same path. That is a question
 * about the command's PROVENANCE, not its text, so closing it needs the
 * harness to mark the commands it issued — a different mechanism from
 * parsing, and not one this module can reach.
 *
 * `test/bash-write-guard.test.ts` pins the conclusion rather than leaving it
 * as prose: the sanctioned commands must stay ALLOWED, so the next person to
 * reach for the obvious fix gets a red suite naming what it costs.

 * delimited", which refuses. The other spelling, a denylist of operators
 * (`+`, `%`, `.replace`, an f-string, …), is a detector narrower than what

 * what #1276's stopgap was a second attempt at.

 * argument of no call, so it is not a write position — and it also catches the
 * dict KEY, the ternary branch, and the inner call's default that the `:` drop

 * case-folded, as `names()` already is, because `/Users/JHORN/…` and
 * `/Users/jhorn/…` are one file and two strings on this volume. It was
 * built, and then the mutation battery refused to witness it: removing the
 * fold left the SHOUTED row refused anyway, because `resolveThroughLinks`
 * climbs to the deepest EXISTING ancestor and `realpathSync` returns the
 * canonical case — `/USERS` comes back `/Users`. So the fold decided
 * nothing that the resolution had not already decided.
 *
 * It is not shipped, and the reason is not thrift. Two deciders answering
 * one question are behaviourally one, no test can tell them apart, and the
 * next reader deletes whichever looks redundant. And on a case-SENSITIVE
 * volume the fold is the wrong answer rather than a spare one: there
 * `/Users/JHORN/x` really is a different file, which the fold would report
 * as live. `names()` folds for a different situation — it matches a
 * basename inside a command string where nothing resolves anything.
 *
 * CI proved both halves of that, and corrected the heading this note used
 * to carry. It said the differential "does not exist here", measured on
 * macOS — and the SHOUTED row went red on the Linux runner, where
 * `/HOME/RUNNER/.rungate/run` is a path that does not exist and is not the
 * artifact. The guard was right on both volumes; the claim was macOS's,
 * read as universal. The row now probes the volume and asserts the verdict
 * tracks it in BOTH directions, so a blind `.toLowerCase()` fold reddens it
 * on Linux and dropping the resolution reddens it on macOS.
 *
 * #1211 / #1358 is the same QUESTION about `WorkflowStateGuard` and may
 * well have a different answer, because that matcher has no resolution step

 * Which path literals in an interpreter body can be shown to be the write

 *
 * ## The mistake this replaces
 *
 * Every escape in this family is the same one wearing a different costume:
 * the exemption read a path LITERAL off the command line and treated it as
 * the destination. #1276 shipped a labelled stopgap — "is every absolute
 * literal in the body scratch" — which closed the one spelling that had been
 * measured and left the class open, because a computed destination need not
 * leave a non-scratch literal behind. Four spellings that it exempts and
 * this refuses are asserted in `test/bash-write-guard.test.ts`; the one that
 * matters least is also the one that reads worst:
 *
 *     bun -e 'writeFileSync("/tmp/x/workflow-state.json"
 *               .replace("/tmp/x", process.env.RUNGATE_WORK_DIR), "{}")'
 *
 * Every absolute literal in it is scratch. The write lands in the run store.
 *
 * ## What is asked instead
 *
 * A literal is a target only when nothing between it and the filesystem
 * transforms it — then, and only then, `isScratchPath` resolving it answers
 * the real question. A carrying literal that does NOT stand alone is not
 * evidence against the write, it is the ABSENCE of evidence for it, so it
 * ends the exemption rather than being ignored. That is the same fail-closed
 * reading `isScratchPath` already applies to a relative path.
 *
 * The three things this still does not do are stated rather than hidden.
 * It cannot see an assembled NAME (`'workflow' + '-state.json'`) — no
 * literal carries the artifact, so arm 3 never receives a candidate, which
 * is a limit of the candidate search and has its own asserted row. It does
 * not read a program in a FILE. And `eval` defeats it, as it defeats any
 * reading of a program that does not run it.

 * The literal is followed by a newline, so it read as a complete argument;

 * Python continue an expression across a newline, so "a newline ends a
 * statement" is true only of a statement nothing encloses — which this walk
 * cannot tell apart from a line break inside one. A detector a reformat
 * defeats is the second shape in
 * `.claude/rules/checks-must-be-able-to-fail.md`, and it defeated the exact

 * ordinary multi-line fixture, because looking back through a newline from
 * a literal that starts a line lands on the `(` or `,` that really opened
 * it.
 *
 * ## The LEADING half has no witness, and that is said rather than implied
 *
 * The trailing half is the escape above, executed. The leading half —
 * `x +\n  "…"`, where a literal opening a line read as unconsumed — is
 * symmetry, and no harmful instance of it exists that I could write: for it
 * to matter the literal must be scratch AND carry a protected artifact AND
 * be the right operand of a concatenation, and a scratch absolute path is
 * not a suffix of anything. It is kept because the two halves ask one
 * question and an asymmetric rule invites the next reader to restore the
 * half that looks arbitrary. Measured cost over 131,942 real commands:
 * 0 newly blocked, 0 newly allowed, and the exemption population does not

 * path the reader cannot PLACE, or no literal carries the artifact at all.

 * is `exempt > 0`, not `newly blocked == 0`.
 *
 * ## Why the live-tree reading is a separate question (#1371)
 *
 * The last line is `every` over `targets`, and `targets` only ever receives
 * literals that matched `ALL_PROTECTED`. So the quantifier ranges over a set
 * the command's author chooses the membership of, and the two readings come
 * apart on a body that writes a protected artifact into scratch AND touches
 * a live tree under a name no list has:
 *
 *     shutil.copy('/tmp/fix/workflow-state.json', '$HOME/.rungate/run')

 * Every member of `targets` is scratch, so `every` says yes; the copy lands
 * in the run store. `main` refused this, this module allowed it until
 * #1371, and 50,189 real commands could not see it — an honest caller does
 * not write it, which is exactly who it is worth something to.
 *
 * `protectedLiterals` is the reading that does not go through a name list,
 * so it cannot be walked around by choosing a basename. The alternative on
 * the table was a second whole-body gate ANDed with this one, and it was
 * refused: two deciders answering one question are behaviourally one, no
 * test can tell them apart, and the next reader deletes the live half —

    //    #1146: the TARGET list widened from PROTECTED_HOOKS to every
    //    protected artifact; the VERB test is untouched, and that asymmetry is
    //    the point. There was no reason for a `chmod` on `.gate-salt` to be
    //    allowed while a `chmod` on a `.hook.ts` was refused — mode bits are
    //    how a file stops being writable, so a permission change on the gate
    //    salt is a step toward writing it. Measured on the 5,059 allowed
    //    commands naming a protected artifact, the widening newly blocks
    //    exactly one, and that one is real:
    //      `chmod 600 …/worktrees/agent-abbce…/hooks/lib/.gate-salt`

    //    is not a permission change on a protected artifact. The widened

    //    word must BE `security`, which an issue comment's `gh` never is.
