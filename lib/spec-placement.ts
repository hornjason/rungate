/**
 * A spec's *Phase placement* table, and the milestones derived from it (#1647).
 *
 * `docs/adr/ADR-003-spec-to-tracker-mapping.md` decides the model: a criterion
 * is placed in the spec, a milestone is DERIVED from that placement, and an
 * issue carries the milestone and names its criteria. This file is step 2 of
 * that ADR made executable — until it existed, step 2 was eight milestones
 * created by hand with `gh`.
 *
 * ## Why derived rather than typed, measured on the eight that were typed
 *
 * The convergence milestones were created by hand on 2026-10-28 from the same
 * phase headings this function reads, and **two of the eight already disagree
 * with their heading**: `### Phase 0 — three settings, no engineering` became
 * *Convergence Phase 0 — three settings*, and `### Phase 4 — findings get
 * answered, and repeats get fixed at the source` became *Convergence Phase 4 —
 * findings get answered*. Nothing was wrong at the time and nothing noticed
 * since; a name typed from a heading is a copy, and a copy drifts. That is the
 * same defect as a spec listing issue numbers, one artefact over.
 *
 * ## The phase NUMBER is the identity, not the title
 *
 * {@link milestonePlan} matches an existing milestone on its phase number and
 * reports a title that no longer matches as a RENAME, never as a milestone to
 * create. Matching on the title would have produced eight duplicates against
 * the live repository on the first run, and a duplicate milestone silently
 * splits a phase's issues into two lanes that each look complete.
 *
 * ## What this does NOT decide
 *
 * Which criteria belong in one ISSUE. That is judgement — a criterion needs
 * several issues and an issue serves several criteria (ADR-003, *Cardinality*)
 * — and a tool that guessed it would file issues nobody asked for against rule
 * 7's opened-to-closed ratio. {@link uncoveredByMilestone} reports the input
 * to that decision and stops there.

 * "this returned a number" — so `plan-deps` narrowing a population and
 * `board-snapshot` matching the board are the same decision, not two that
 * happen to agree.
 *
 * Round 2 of #1705 found them disagreeing. `inMilestoneFamily` tested
 * `startsWith(`${prefix} Phase `)`, which admits anything at all after the
 * space; this needs a number there. On `"Pipeline Phase  1 — oops"` — one
 * stray space — the first said yes and this says no, so `plan-deps` would
 * have sequenced an issue whose phase `board-snapshot` files as unmanaged
 * and `lib/board-mirror.ts` reads as 1. Two spellings of one grammar drift
 * the moment either is edited, and nothing behavioural can see which of
 * them a case is holding up: `.claude/rules/checks-must-be-able-to-fail.md`,
 * fourth shape.
 *
 * The prefix is escaped, so a family name containing regex punctuation is
 * matched literally rather than compiled.
 *
 * Not to be confused with `phaseOf` in `lib/board-mirror.ts`, which reads a
 * phase number out of ANY title regardless of family. That one answers a
 * different question — "what phase is this, whoever owns it" — and is the
 * reason `--milestone-prefix` has to narrow the population before the order
 * is derived.
