/**
 * The one Bun version for a project (#622).
 *
 * Nothing in this repository pinned the runtime. `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
 * and `gates.yml` carried `bun-version: "latest"`, `release.yml` carried the
 * literal `"1.3.14"`, the development machine ran 1.3.14 and CI's `latest`
 * resolved to **1.4.3** — a full minor apart, with nothing comparing any of
 * the four.
 *
 * `latest` is the opposite of a pin: the runtime executing a given commit can
 * change between two runs of that same commit, with nothing in the diff to
 * explain a new failure. Re-running a red job was also a Bun upgrade, and a
 * green local run could not say which runtime produced it.
 *
 * ## Why this is a module and not a string in two template literals
 *
 * It was two, and they were fed by `harness?.ci?.bunVersion || "latest"` in
 * `lib/scaffold/steps.ts` while two other workflow files — neither of them
 * generated — named versions of their own. Four positions, three spellings,
 * no decider. This is #87's fix for the type check and #488's for the test
 * command, applied to the step directly beside them: one binding, so a
 * mutation of it can show that the agreement is load-bearing rather than
 * coincidental.
 *
 * ## The rungs, and what each one is not
 *
 * 1. **`.bun-version` at the project root.** The ecosystem's file:
 *    `oven-sh/setup-bun` reads it through `bun-version-file`, and so do
 *    `mise` and `asdf`. It wins because it is the file CI itself obeys —
 *    a resolver that preferred something else would be naming a version CI
 *    does not install.
 * 2. **`ci.bunVersion` in the rungate config.** The field the harness has
 *    documented since SC-86, and the only declaration a consumer who has not
 *    adopted `.bun-version` has. Emitted as a literal, because there is no
 *    file for CI to point at.
 * 3. **Nothing.** `null`, and the state is named `undeclared` rather than
 *    quietly becoming `latest`. `.claude/rules/config-access.md`: a built-in
 *    default substituted for an absent declaration must be loud, because `0`,
 *    `{}`, `null` and silence are all indistinguishable from success.
 *
 * ## What this does NOT cover
 *
 * - **Which bun is on the developer's PATH.** Two installations from two
 *   package managers sit on the issue's machine; this reports the mismatch,
 *   it cannot fix it. That is what `bunVersionReading` is for.
 * - **Whether the declared version exists.** A pin CI cannot resolve fails
 *   the job, loudly, naming the value — which is the point. A
 *   well-formedness guard with `|| "latest"` behind it is the cheapest repair
 *   for that failure and is exactly the silent fallback AC-7 forbids, so
 *   `isPinnedBunVersion` refuses moving tags and nothing else.
 * - **`package.json` `engines.bun` and `.tool-versions`.** Neither exists in
 *   this tree, and a rung nobody declares is a rung nothing can test. Add one
 *   here, with a case, if a consumer turns up on it — not before.
 * - **`workflows/*.js`.** They cannot import (#69) and none of them installs
 *   bun; if one ever does, it reads the resolved config the way every other
 *   workflow prompt does.

 * has — including one CI cannot resolve.
 *
 * ## Why the pin test is asked here and not only by the checker (#932)
 *
 * `isPinnedBunVersion` had exactly one consumer — `scripts/contract-parity.ts`
 * — and the generator was not it. So a consumer declaring
 * `ci.bunVersion: "latest"` had `bun-version: "latest"` written into a managed
 * workflow under prose describing a successful declaration, and the only way
 * to learn otherwise was to run the checker, which then called that same line
 * a violation. One predicate, two positions, opposite behaviour.
 *
 * Worse, it inverted the rungs: a project declaring NOTHING got the loud block
 * below, and a project declaring a moving tag got silence. Declaring `latest`
 * was reported strictly better than declaring nothing, while installing the
 * same runtime.
 *
 * The VALUE is still emitted verbatim at every rung. `MOVING_BUN_TAGS` says
 * declaring one "is a legitimate thing for a consumer to choose", and
 * substituting a pin here would change a consumer's runtime without being
 * asked — which is AC-7's forbidden silent fallback wearing a fix. What
 * changes is only that the file says what it is.
