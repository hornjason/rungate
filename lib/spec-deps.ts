/**
 * The phase order as `blocked by` edges — step 5 of ADR-003, made executable.
 *
 * `AGENTS.md` rule 4: *"Ordering is data, not prose. Use GitHub's `blocked
 * by`. 'Not adoptable before X' in a sentence is unreadable by every tool we
 * own."* The convergence spec states its phase order deliberately — Phase 3
 * is *"sequenced third rather than first because a reviewer given more
 * context and no falsification step produces more confident false premises"*
 * — and until this file existed that ordering reached the board only as the
 * milestone a card sat in. A milestone is a label, not an edge: nothing could
 * answer *what can I pick up* without a person reading the phase numbers.
 *
 * ## Why the previous phase and not the whole prefix
 *
 * An issue in phase N is blocked by every issue in the phase immediately
 * before it, and transitively by everything earlier through those. Writing
 * the full prefix instead would state the same ordering with O(n²) edges that
 * each have to be removed by hand when a phase is re-scoped, and GitHub
 * renders every one of them on the card.
 *
 * ## The phase sequence is the phases that EXIST, never N-1 arithmetic
 *
 * {@link dependencyPlan} sorts the phases that actually carry issues and hands
 * that list to {@link chainAdjacentPhases}. A spec whose placement table skips
 * a number — Phase 0, 1, 3 with nothing in 2 — would otherwise leave Phase 3
 * blocked by a phase that does not exist, which reads as *unblocked* and puts
 * the last phase in the Ready lane beside the first.
 *
 * ## It never removes an edge
 *
 * An edge this file did not derive is reported as {@link DependencyPlan.extra}
 * and left alone. Two live instances on 2026-10-29 are real and neither is
 * derivable here: #1481 blocked by #1591 (the ballot cannot subtract until the
 * jury runs) and #1659 blocked by #1658 (nothing to rescore until the case set
 * exists) — both WITHIN a phase, which is exactly the dependency a phase order
 * cannot express. A tool that reconciled by deletion would silently destroy
 * the only hand-authored ordering in the repository.
 *
 * ## Closed issues are not blockers, and that is why the derivation skips them
 *
 * A closed issue can never block anything — GitHub's
 * `issueDependenciesSummary.blockedBy` counts OPEN blockers, and
 * `lib/board-mirror.ts`'s `isUnblocked` reads that count. An edge to a closed
 * issue is therefore a row on a card that changes no decision. Pass
 * `includeClosed` to derive them anyway; the default is to leave them out.

 * ## Why this is a table and not another `if`
 *
 * The first version refused on `issues.length === 0` and on
 * `phases.length === 1`, and four review rounds each found a different input
 * that walks between them. The last was `phases.length === 0`: issues exist,
 * so the empty-input guard is skipped, and there is no single phase, so the
 * one-phase guard is skipped — and an unphased board reports `0 missing`,
 * which `scripts/plan-deps.ts` prints as *"the tracker already carries the
 * phase order"*. That sentence is false and it is the flattering reading.
 *
 * The reviewer's own process finding named the shape: *a UNMEASURED check
 * written for one specific empty-input shape, not the class of them*, which
 * a line-level patch keeps reintroducing variants of. `AGENTS.md` rule 5
 * says to stop repairing and re-scope at the third round. So the guard is
 * stated once, as the property it is actually about:
 *
 * > **An order needs two phases.** Fewer than two cannot express one, and
 * > every row below is a different way of arriving at fewer than two.
 *
 * | # | Condition | What it means |
 * |---|---|---|
 * | 1 | nothing read | a failed fetch and an empty repository are the same bytes |
 * | 2 | read, none considered | every issue was filtered out — all closed, without `--include-closed` |
 * | 3 | considered, no phase | nobody carries a `Phase N` milestone: `plan-spec` never ran, or the naming drifted from `phaseOf` |
 * | 4 | one phase | nothing to sequence, which is not the same as already sequenced |
 * | 5 | a truncated blocker list | an unread edge past the page boundary reads as missing and gets re-added |
 *
 * Rows 1-4 are exhaustive over `phases.length < 2` by construction: a
 * non-empty considered set with two or more distinct phases is the only
 * input that reaches none of them. Row 5 is orthogonal — the phases can be
 * fine while the live edge list is short — so it is checked alongside rather
 * than inside the count.
