# ADR-006: The six Convergence Machinery issues, classified

## Status

**Accepted on 2026-10-31** — the adjudication is correct and is the decision
of record.

**Its decision has NOT been applied to the tracker, and accepting it does not
make that true.** Measured on 2026-10-31 against the table below, all six
rows, not a sample:

| Issue | What the table assigns | On the tracker today |
|---|---|---|
| #1495 | `CRC-C2` | open, body does not cite CRC-C2 |
| #1497 | `CRC-C2` | open, body does not cite CRC-C2 |
| #1571 | `CRC-C2` | open, body does not cite CRC-C2 |
| #1257 | `(b)` none — machinery | open, body does not say machinery |
| #1173 | `(b)` none — machinery | open, body does not say machinery |
| #1157 | `(b)` none — machinery | open, body does not say machinery |

Six of six unrepaired. Every one of these issues still renders on the board
exactly as it did before this ADR was written — a blank Criteria cell that
reads the same whether nobody looked or somebody decided — which is the
condition the ADR exists to remove.

Re-take the table rather than trusting it. This reading is of the tracker,
not of this repository, so no test can hold it current:

```
$ for N in 1495 1497 1571 1257 1173 1157; do
    printf '#%s %s  ' "$N" "$(gh issue view $N --json state --jq .state)"
    gh issue view $N --json body --jq .body | grep -oE 'CRC-[A-Z]+[0-9]+|machinery' | sort -u | tr '\n' ' '
    echo
  done
```

A row whose *On the tracker today* cell stops matching that output means
the repair happened and this section is stale — which is the outcome this
ADR wants, and the one nothing here can notice on its own.

Recorded here rather than silently ticked. Accepting the reading and applying
it are two acts, and only the first has happened.

## The question this answers

Not *"do these name a criterion"* — measured, and none of them does. The
question is **should they**, which is an adjudication and belongs in a
reviewed table rather than in a tool.

Answered by reading all six bodies in full on 2026-10-29, against the Phase
placement table in `specs/CODE-REVIEW-CONVERGENCE-SPEC.md`.

## The reading

**Three of the six serve CRC-C2.** They are the three issues about the
`ai-review` waiver disarm step (#1242) — the mechanism that stops a pull
request whose review was waived by `ai-review-override` from merging unread.
CRC-C2 is *"A PR cannot merge while any bug-review or security-review finding
is open"*, and #1495 names the connection itself: *"SUCCESS.md claim 3 — bad
ships are stopped."*

**Three serve nothing, and that is the correct answer for them.** Two are
about this repository's own test suite — a duration regression detector and a
flaky case — and one is about re-deriving a tuning parameter. None of them
makes a criterion true or false. They are maintenance, and an issue that is
maintenance should say so rather than leave a blank cell that reads the same
as an oversight.

| Issue | Repair | Criteria | Confidence | Why |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| #1495 | (a) | `CRC-C2` | HIGH | The disarm is one-shot: `auto_merge_enabled` is not in `AI_REVIEW_PULL_REQUEST_TYPES`, so re-arming after the final run leaves a waived PR armed with no later run to disarm it. A waived review that merges itself is C2 failing. The issue states the claim it moves. |
| #1497 | (a) | `CRC-C2` | MEDIUM | Same step, different route in: bare `gh` off `PATH` with the reviewer's inherited environment, and `$GITHUB_ENV` carries into it. A `GH_HOST` or `GH_CONFIG_DIR` planted by an earlier step points the disarm's two `gh` calls at config the reviewer chose — and the job's tree-modification guard subtracts the path `$GITHUB_ENV` lives under, so it cannot see it. The outcome is the same as #1495's: armed, waived, unread. |
| #1571 | (a) | `CRC-C2` | MEDIUM | **The contested row.** Its failure direction is the opposite of the other two: a labelled PR with auto-merge armed is red *by construction* (0 of 65 executed attempts took the armed-and-disarmed branch), so the check blocks merges rather than permitting them. The case for C2 is second-order — a required check that can only be red is one operators route around, and the route around is the bypass C2 forbids. Read it before accepting it; the honest alternative is (b). |
| #1257 | (b) | — | MEDIUM | Re-derive `AI_REVIEW_MAX_TURNS` once the post-#1243 distribution is large enough. Calibrating a parameter so reviews finish is upkeep of an instrument, not a criterion being proved. The nearest criterion is CRC-M12's `diff_truncated`, and it is not the same thing: M12 asks that an unreadable round *name its mode*, which a turn budget neither records nor affects. |
| #1173 | (b) | — | HIGH | Raising the per-test ceiling to 120 s removed the accidental duration-regression detector for six `ai-review-*` suites. A proposal for a duration ratchet over this repository's own test suite. No criterion in the spec is about how long our tests take. |
| #1157 | (b) | — | HIGH | `AC-10` drift-step cases fail locally and a different case fails each run — timing sensitivity, not a wrong assertion, and not a regression from the change it was found under. A flaky local test. No criterion. |

## `(b)` means something different here than it did in ADR-005

In ADR-005, `(b)` was **demote** — remove the issue from a `Convergence Phase
N` milestone it did not belong in, because a stray card in a phase keeps that
phase open after every criterion in it is true, and blocks the whole next
phase through `plan-deps`.

`Convergence Machinery` is not a phase. `plan-deps` derives edges over
`Convergence Phase N` milestones only, so nothing in this milestone carries
order or appears in the frontier, and demoting these three would change
nothing. The repair they need is **an explicit `none — machinery` written into
the body**, so the board's Criteria column distinguishes *deliberately serves
no criterion* from *nobody has looked*. Those render identically today, and
that is the whole defect: a blank cell is unactionable.

## The three `(a)` rows need a repair kind that does not exist yet

They serve CRC-C2, and CRC-C2 is placed in **Phase 6**. They sit in
`Convergence Machinery`, which is outside the derivation entirely — so three
issues on the critical path to a Phase 6 criterion carry no dependency edges,
never block anything, and never surface as *what is next*.

Annotating them is necessary and not sufficient. `plan-issues --repair` has
two kinds, `annotate` and `demote`, and neither **promotes** an issue into a
phase milestone. Options, in the order I would take them:

1. **Add a `(c) promote` kind** taking a target phase, which sets the
   milestone and then leaves `plan-deps --write` to derive the edges. This is
   the one that keeps the pipeline whole — the milestone becomes a derived
   consequence of a reviewed table, like every other step.
2. Set the three milestones by hand and re-run `plan-deps`. Faster, and it
   puts a decision back in somebody's head, which is the thing this whole
   workstream exists to stop.

Promotion is deferred to its own change rather than bundled here, because it
adds a write that can move an issue *into* the order — and an edge derived
from a wrong promotion is worse than a missing one.

## What this does not claim

That the six were misfiled. `Convergence Machinery` is a reasonable home for
#1257, #1173 and #1157 and they should stay in it. What was wrong is that the
milestone's meaning was never written down, so it absorbed three issues that
belong in Phase 6 without anything being able to notice.
