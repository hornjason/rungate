# Code Map — rungate

Auto-generated architecture snapshot. Re-run `bun generate-code-map.ts .` to refresh.
Regenerate when src/ has commits since scanned-at-sha.

**What this guarantees:** the sections below describe the tree at `scanned-at-sha`.
**What it does not:** that `scanned-at-sha` is the commit you are reading this on. The scan
runs on a branch tip and the squash merge lands it on a `main` that has already moved, so this
file is at best one merge behind and no drift gate can close that (#1163). Per-directory file
counts were removed for the same reason — 22 of 50 consecutive commits moved one. Treat every
row as orientation, not as a fact about your working tree.
