/**
 * HookCurrency.hook.ts — report installed git hooks that are not what the
 * generator produces today (#879)
 *
 * SC-370 (HOOK-ARCHITECTURE-SPEC): Hook SC traceability
 * SC-371 (HOOK-ARCHITECTURE-SPEC): No hook exceeds 150 lines
 *
 * TRIGGER: SessionStart
 *
 * CADENCE, stated rather than implied: once per session. Not PreToolUse.
 * The reading costs a `git rev-parse`, two file reads and a string compare,
 * which is nothing per session and is noise on every tool call — and a
 * message an operator sees forty times an hour is a message they stop
 * reading, which is the failure mode this hook exists to avoid rather than
 * one it can afford to risk.
 *
 * #874 taught the check to read the hook git will actually run. #891 taught
 * it to read every hook the scaffold installs rather than one. Neither
 * reached anybody, because nothing ran it: the script had to be remembered,
 * and `.git/hooks/` is untracked, so a developer whose pre-commit predates a
 * fix has no position in the repository that can tell them. Measured on this
 * repository on 2026-10-21, both hooks were stale and had been for days.
 *
 * Thin trigger: every decision is `scripts/check-installed-hook-currency.ts`.
 * This file chooses a root, prints, and exits 0.
 *
 * ## The second reading: Claude Code hooks, not git hooks (#1216)
 *
 * The same shape one layer out. `.git/hooks` is untracked, so nothing in the
 * repository can see what is installed there — and a Claude Code hook
 * registration names a DIRECTORY, so nothing can see which commit the bytes
 * it executes are on either. Why a startup report rather than a suite case or
 * a line per hook, why this hook survives the staleness it reports, and why
 * it REPORTS and never repairs: `lib/hook-tree-currency.ts`. The runner below
 * passes through whatever that module asks for, so the query-only constraint
 * is asserted where the subcommands are chosen —
 * `test/unit/hook-tree-currency.test.ts` HC-16.

/**
 * A SessionStart hook never fails the session. Every exit here is 0, and
 * that is the whole of #879's third criterion: a fresh clone, a CI checkout
 * and a tree whose hooks are perfect must all be survivable, so the only
 * thing this hook can do about a stale hook is SAY so.
 *
 * It is also why the refusal CLASS matters more here than the exit code.
 * With no class to read, "no pre-commit is installed" and "the pre-commit
 * that runs on every commit predates #728" would arrive under one label,
 * and the fresh clone's harmless reading would train the operator to
 * ignore the other one.
