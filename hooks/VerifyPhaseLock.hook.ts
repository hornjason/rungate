/**
 * VerifyPhaseLock.hook.ts — PreToolUse on Bash
 *
 * SC-370 (HOOK-ARCHITECTURE-SPEC): Hook SC traceability
 * SC-371 (HOOK-ARCHITECTURE-SPEC): No hook exceeds 150 lines
 *
 * TWO independent gates on one chokepoint — a filing reaching Bash, in any
 * spelling `createsIssue` knows (#1759). Both decisions live in lib/ and
 * not here (#365, HOOK-ARCHITECTURE-SPEC: hooks are thin triggers).
 *
 * 1. **The VERIFY-phase lock** (#443, #365). Workflow discipline: during
 *    VERIFY, use verifyBlockers[] instead. Waived by the override labels in
 *    lib/issue-create-override.ts. It used to be a substring test on the
 *    whole command, which a `follow-up` in an issue TITLE satisfied.
 *
 * 2. **The finding adjudication** (#1261), on every phase. Asks whether the
 *    finding earned a filing — duplicate, or a dropped category — through
 *    lib/finding-arbiter.ts's own bindings. Before this, the only question
 *    asked at this chokepoint was gate 1's, and gate 1 tests whether an agent
 *    typed a label. lib/issue-filing-gate.ts has the measurement and the
 *    reason the two gates do not share an override label.
 *
 * Asked in that order because gate 1 is a cheap local read and gate 2 may pay
 * for a `gh issue list`.
 *
 * Issue: #443, #1261
