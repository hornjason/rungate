/**
 * HarnessAFKGate.hook.ts - Block AskUserQuestion during AFK harness runs (PreToolUse)
 *
 * Governing SCs: SC-370 (traceability), SC-371 (thin trigger, under 150 lines)
 *
 * PURPOSE:
 * When a harness PRD exists with phase in build/execute/verify (post-approval
 * phases), block AskUserQuestion calls. The agent must make judgment calls
 * autonomously — interrupting the user during AFK harness runs is a protocol
 * violation.
 *
 * TRIGGER: PreToolUse (matcher: AskUserQuestion)
 *
 * BEHAVIOR:
 * - Scans WORK_DIR for the most recently modified PRD.md
 * - If PRD frontmatter has phase: build|execute|verify → BLOCK (exit 2 with reason)
 * - If no PRD, or phase is observe|think|plan|complete|learn → ALLOW (exit 0)
 *
 * This is a mechanical enforcement — impossible to violate.
 * See HARNESS-STANDARD.md "AFK autonomy rule" for the policy.
 *
 * PORTABILITY (#713): the work directory comes from `./lib/paths`'s
 * `WORK_DIR`, which resolves `RUNGATE_WORK_DIR` and otherwise `~/.rungate` —
 * a rungate-owned directory, not a PAI one. The `.pai` copy's docstring said
 * it scanned `MEMORY/WORK/`; that was stale there and is corrected here,
 * because a shipped hook's stated behaviour is what a consumer debugs against.
 * The PRD-driven ship lifecycle is rungate's own.
