 *
 * The previous pattern was `--repo\s+(\S+)`, which ran to the next space and

 *
 * This parses a command string to infer what `gh` will do, which is a
 * differential by construction: anywhere the two disagree, the guard checks
 * one repository's labels and `gh` closes an issue in another. Three
 * disagreements were found by checking against the real binary rather than
 * assuming, and all three are closed here:
 *
 *   gh issue view 23 --repo a/pai-config --repo b/pai-harness  -> LAST wins
 *   gh issue view 23 -R b/pai-harness                          -> `-R` is a real alias
 *   GH_REPO=b/pai-harness gh issue view 23                     -> env is honoured
 *
 * The first was a guard bypass: taking the first occurrence let
 * `--repo unprotected/x --repo protected/y` be vetted against `unprotected/x`
