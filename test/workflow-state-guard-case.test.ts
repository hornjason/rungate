/**
 * #1211 — what `WorkflowStateGuard`'s path matcher claims authority over,
 * enumerated rather than sampled.
 *
 * The defect: the guard matched with a case-SENSITIVE `String.includes()`, so a
 * `Write` of a forged gate result to `WORKFLOW-STATE.JSON` was permitted. #1184
 * had already closed exactly this in `GateResultProtection` — which case-folds —
 * and the fix was never carried to the blanket guard. It is the blanket guard
 * that SHIPS (`deployToConsumers: true`), so on a scaffolded consumer tree,
 * where the specific guard is not deployed, that input reached disk with no
 * guard at all. In this repository the specific guard happened to cover it,
 * which is how an overlap hides a gap locally while leaving it open downstream.
 *
 * ## Why this file plants no files
 *
 * The guard is a pure predicate over the `file_path` STRING in the hook
 * payload — it never stats, opens or resolves anything. A fixture that planted
 * `WORKFLOW-STATE.JSON` and `workflow-state.json` and asserted something about
 * the pair would be asserting that APFS is case-insensitive, not that the guard
 * is case-folded, and it would read differently on a case-sensitive filesystem
 * while the guard had not moved. Every row below is a string handed to the
 * guard. The filesystem is not part of the instrument.
 *
 * (That the two spellings ARE one file on a case-insensitive filesystem is the
 * reason the fold is correct, and it was measured in #1184. It is a premise of
 * this fix, not a thing this file re-measures.)
 *
 * ## Why a mutant, and why the delta is the assertion
 *
 * A case-fold can only widen what a matcher refuses, and widening a guard is
 * not automatically safe: a fold that reached past the artifact would hand the
 * guard authority over files nobody decided it should hold. So the claim worth
 * binding is not "the uppercase spelling is now caught" — one row cannot say
 * anything about the population — but "the refusal set grew by EXACTLY these
 * case-variants, and shrank by nothing".
 *
 * That needs the before-reading, so this runs the pre-#1211 matcher as well:
 * the real hook spawned from `hooks/`, and a mutant copy with `.toLowerCase()`
 * deleted, which is the old code character for character. The two are run over
 * one corpus and the difference between them is measured. Deleting the fold
 * from the real hook makes `the fold widens by exactly the case-variants` and
 * `the uppercase spelling is refused` go red — that is the break, performed.
 *
 * Related: `test/workflow-state-write-contract.test.ts` row 8 is this same
 * input inside the two-hook contract; it flipped to REFUSED in the same commit.
