/**
 * A posted review thread carries the identity it was raised under.
 *
 * Increment 1's prerequisite, and the ACs at #1614 do not name it because it
 * is only visible once you try to write AC-1. AC-1 says the suppression gate
 * decides "already raised" from `pulls/{n}/comments` plus GraphQL
 * `isResolved` rather than from the ledger snapshot. To decide that, a thread
 * fetched from the API has to be reducible to the SAME key `carryKey`
 * produces for a fresh finding — and measured on `origin/main` at `aed22884`,
 * `threadBody` emits severity, summary and failure scenario and nothing else.
 * There is no key in a posted thread, so "is this finding already a thread"
 * is not a question the thread list can answer, at any amount of care in the
 * caller.
 *
 * The near-miss is matching on the rendered text. It works on the happy path
 * and that is exactly what makes it the wrong fix: a summary is prose written
 * by a model, it is re-wrapped by GitHub, and `checkoutLineText`'s docblock
 * already records what happens when two sides of a dedupe compute keys in
 * different namespaces — `kept: 1, suppressed: 0` on a planted exact repeat,
 * silently, forever.
 *
 * So the thread carries the key, in an HTML comment GitHub does not render.
 *
 * ## What was broken to prove each case can fail
 *
 * TI-1 goes red if the marker is not emitted at all (the state on `main`).
 * TI-2 goes red under the FIRST fix anybody writes — spelling the key into
 * the comment as raw text. A key whose line text contains `-->` closes the
 * comment early, and every assertion in TI-1 still passes, so TI-2 is the
 * only row that separates the encoded fix from the unencoded one.
 * TI-3 and TI-4 go red if a missing or corrupt marker is read as a key
 * instead of as an absence; both directions suppress a live finding.
 * TI-5 goes red if the writer and the reader stop agreeing on the marker.
 * TI-6 goes red if a caller that supplies no key still gets a marker, which
 * would make "no key recorded" and "key recorded" the same bytes.
