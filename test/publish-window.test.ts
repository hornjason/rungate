/**
 * Covers SC-823, SC-824 (HARNESS-STANDARD.md) — the publish window, and the
 * three states a naive check collapses into one.
 *
 * #1237 — every publish reddened `main` until a human edited `SUCCESS.md`.
 * #1226 — the same release, the other side of the publish, reported as a
 * repo-wide merge block.
 *
 * Both are the same reading taken by two checks with two tolerances, and
 * neither check could tell these apart:
 *
 *   1. the tree declares a version the registry does not have YET — a release
 *      is in flight, and the only honest answer is to wait;
 *   2. somebody bumped the version and never published — a real defect that
 *      must stay red, because `main` is claiming a version no consumer can
 *      obtain and nothing is going to fix that on its own;
 *   3. the registry HAS the version and its `latest` dist-tag has not caught
 *      up — a propagation artefact of the read, not a fact about the tree.
 *
 * State 3 is decided WITHOUT a clock, from the versions list — the same
 * reading `release.yml`'s postflight trusts and for the same reason (#445): a
 * dist-tag is a pointer that moves on its own schedule, and three consecutive
 * successful releases were reported as failures by reading it.
 *
 * States 1 and 2 are the same instant observed through different futures, so
 * nothing but elapsed time separates them. The separator is the release tag:
 * a release is triggered by pushing `v<version>`, so a tree carrying a version
 * with no such tag was never released at all, and a tag older than the window
 * is a release that was triggered and did not land.
