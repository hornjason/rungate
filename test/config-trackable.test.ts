/**
 * #505 — the harness config must not live where git thinks it is disposable.
 *
 * ## What this battery must be capable of showing, stated before it was run
 *
 * The headline case is a real `git checkout`, not a model of one. Asserting
 * "the config survives" without running the command asserts my reading of
 * `gitignore(5)`, and the issue is open precisely because that reading was
 * wrong in the recommendation it carries. So the control has to be able to
 * demonstrate BOTH directions against the same temporary repository:
 *
 *  1. **The loss, reproduced.** With the project's rules unchanged, a branch
 *     switch DELETES `.claude/rungate.json` from the working tree. If this
 *     arm cannot show the deletion, the fixture is not #505 and nothing the
 *     other arm says is evidence about it.
 *  2. **The loss, impossible.** After the scaffold's negation, a plain
 *     `git add -A` picks the config up — no `-f` — and the same branch
 *     switch leaves the file byte-identical.
 *  3. **The cheap wrong fix still failing.** The negation the issue
 *     recommends, `!.claude/rungate.json` on its own, must still leave the
 *     path ignored and `git add` still refusing. A fixture that goes green
 *     under the repair someone reaches for certifies that repair
 *     (`.claude/rules/checks-must-be-able-to-fail.md`, fifth shape).
 *
 * Every repository below is created by `mkdtemp` and removed in the same
 * `finally`. Nothing here touches a repository anyone is working in.
