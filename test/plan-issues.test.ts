/**
 * Covers SC-2608 (SPEC-TO-BOARD-PIPELINE-SPEC.md).
 *
 * `lib/issue-repair.ts` and `scripts/plan-issues.ts --repair` (#1647).
 *
 * ## The write cases assert on the CALLS
 *
 * `plan-spec` shipped a refusal computed after its write loop: the mutations
 * went out and the exit code then said the run had been refused. Nothing
 * reading an exit code can tell that apart from a refusal that stopped
 * something, so every negative case below records what reached GitHub.
 *
 * ## And the demotion cases assert on the ORDER of those calls
 *
 * A demotion removes the issue's edges and then clears its milestone. If the
 * clear ran first and the removal then failed, the issue would already be out
 * of its phase and nothing could still work out which edges to remove — not a
 * re-run of this command, not `plan-deps`, which never removes an edge at all.
 * A test asserting only the SET of calls is green against that ordering bug.
