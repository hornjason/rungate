/**
 * ci-shard-aggregate-measured.test.ts — the aggregate asserts that it
 * MEASURED, not merely that it did not fail (#1181); it does so without `gh`
 * or `actions: read` (#1190); and the evidence it counts is bound to one leg
 * of THIS run attempt (#1190 follow-up).
 *
 * ## The run
 *
 * PR #1154 merged on run `39799846607`. `test-shard (1)`, `(2)` and `(3)`
 * were `queued`, `completed_at: null`, **no conclusion**. Only shard 4
 * completed. The aggregate `test` job read `needs.test-shard.result` as
 * `success`, printed "All 4 shards passed", and went green in three seconds.
 * `test` is a required check and auto-merge is armed repo-wide, so a quarter
 * of the suite authorised the merge.
 *
 * `always()` was added so a **failed or cancelled** shard reaches the
 * aggregate. It is about REACHING the job. The hole is what the job then
 * reads: `needs.<job>.result` collapses a whole matrix into one word, and for
 * a matrix that produced no results that word was `success`.
 *
 * ## The evidence channel, and why it is not the Actions API
 *
 * #1189 asked the jobs API with `gh api`. That worked, and it made every
 * consumer's required check depend on **`gh` on the runner image** — a
 * GitHub-hosted-image fact, not a runner fact, and `ci.runner` is
 * consumer-settable — and on **`actions: read`**. Neither is needed to read a
 * marker: `actions/download-artifact`'s README says a `github-token` and
 * `actions: read` are "required when downloading artifacts from a different
 * repository or from a different workflow run".
 *
 * A marker is also stronger evidence than a conclusion. The API reports what
 * GitHub *recorded* about a job; a marker is a file the job's own shell
 * *wrote*. A leg created and never executed leaves nothing, which is exactly
 * `39799846607`'s three queued shards.
 *
 * ## Why the attempt is part of the evidence — MEASURED, not assumed
 *
 * **Artifacts are scoped to the RUN, not the attempt.** Run `39835866754`, a
 * two-leg matrix re-run with "Re-run failed jobs": on attempt 2 the
 * aggregate's download reported `Found 2 artifact(s)` and handed back
 * `shard-1 => success attempt=1` — written by a leg that **did not execute in
 * attempt 2 at all**. Read as evidence about attempt 2, that is #1181
 * reintroduced: a required check green over a shard that did not run.
 *
 * So the attempt is bound in **two independent places**: the artifact's name
 * and the marker's body. A name is a convention the generator controls; a
 * body is a reading. `M2` below is the name-only fix, run, and it goes green
 * on a marker whose body disagrees with its own name.
 *
 * ## And why the leg is part of it too
 *
 * The first draft uploaded the whole marker directory and downloaded with
 * `merge-multiple: true`, which flattens every artifact into one directory —
 * so the reading was filenames alone and the name's per-leg binding was
 * discarded. A leg writing `shard-1`, `shard-2`, `shard-3` into its own temp
 * directory would contribute evidence for legs it is not. Now the upload
 * names a single FILE and the download keeps one directory per artifact.
 * Measured on run `39836500284`: the leg writes a decoy `shard-99` and the
 * artifact carries only `shard-<its own index>`.
 *
 * ## What is executed here, and why it is the shipped text
 *
 * `buildShardAggregateScript()` returns the script the generator writes into
 * `ci.yml`, and it holds **no `${{ }}` expression** — every GitHub-side value
 * arrives through the step's `env:`. The cases below run the real text
 * against a planted artifact tree, so "a shard never ran" and "a shard's only
 * evidence is from attempt 1" are inputs a test can supply.
 *
 * ## The shell, which is half of what #1191 was about
 *
 * Every case runs under **`-e`**, and under `/usr/bin/bash` wherever that
 * path exists — the runner's own `shell: /usr/bin/bash -e {0}`, read off run
 * `39834155753`'s step echo. #1191 shipped a defect on this exact step that
 * existed only under errexit. `RESOLVED_SHELL` refuses outright rather than
 * dropping to a shell nobody chose, and `errexit is live` is the harness's
 * own control.
 *
 * ## Predicted before the battery ran
 *
 * Shipped script, 16 rows: 3 green (P1, P2, P3), 13 red (N1–N12, two of them
 * two-rowed). Measured 3/13, 0 rows off prediction.
 * Mutant (`SHARD_AGGREGATE_REFUSAL_EXIT` → `0`): 13 of 13 reds flip green.
 *
 * P3 is the row that keeps the refusal honest rather than obstructive: N3
 * tells the operator to re-run ALL jobs, and P3 is that remedy, run.
 *
 * **Two cheapest wrong fixes, named and measured rather than dismissed:**
 * - `M1` — treat a reading you cannot take as nothing to object to
 *   (`[ -d "$dir" ] || exit 0`). Predicted **0 of 3** no-evidence cases.
 * - `M2` — the fix for the re-run hole that stops at the artifact NAME, with
 *   no body cross-check. Predicted **0 of 1** on a marker whose body
 *   disagrees with its name, against 1 of 1 for the shipped script.
