/**
 * Every producer of a `bun test …` selection applies the SAME path guard.
 *
 * ## The defect
 *
 * `scripts/select-affected-tests.ts` has refused to print a path outside
 * `SAFE_TEST_PATH` since it was written, because the generated command is
 * `<testCommand> $(that script)` and word-splitting is how a list becomes
 * arguments. #1054 added a SECOND producer, `scripts/text-dependents.ts`,
 * documenting the same composition in its own docblock, and it printed
 * `r.tests.join(" ")` with no guard at all.
 *
 * Nothing was exploitable: both lists come from a walk of this repository's
 * own tree. **The asymmetry is the finding.** `SAFE_TEST_PATH` exists
 * because somebody already decided this output gets reparsed and that the
 * decision needed enforcing; a guard that one of two producers applies is a
 * guard with a hole, and from inside either file the hole is invisible.
 *
 * The shape is worth naming because it is the shape of the issue that
 * introduced it. #1054 is about *a dependency expressed in a syntax the
 * checker does not know*. This is the same thing one level up: *a
 * validation expressed in one of two producers*.
 *
 * ## What is a witness here and what is a control
 *
 *   WITNESS  "an unsafe path refuses the whole selection" — the behaviour
 *            the new producer did not have.
 *   WITNESS  "the refusal prints nothing on stdout" — in a `$(…)`
 *            composition, empty stdout means the full suite. A partial
 *            selection with the odd entry filtered out is the dangerous
 *            answer: it is the selection missing exactly the file that was
 *            unusual, wearing the look of a result.
 *   WITNESS  "no producer copy-pastes the pattern" — the population check.
 *            A third producer added next year is the whole risk, and it is
 *            the only case here that a future author cannot avoid tripping.
 *            **Read the next section before trusting its name.**
 *   CONTROL  "an ordinary selection is not refused" — a guard that refuses
 *            everything passes every witness above and is useless.
 *   CONTROL  "the two producers hold the SAME binding" — two copies that
 *            happen to agree pass a behavioural test and diverge the first
 *            time one is edited.
 *
 * ## What the population scan does NOT catch
 *
 * It catches the COPY-PASTE, not the paraphrase, and the three gaps were
 * measured against the shipped pattern rather than reasoned about:
 *
 * | written as | caught |
 * |---|---|
 * | `const P = /^[A-Za-z0-9._\/-]+\.test\.tsx?$/` | **yes** |
 * | `const P = /^(?:[A-Za-z0-9._\/-]+)\.test\.tsx?$/` — one group deeper | no |
 * | `const P = new RegExp("^[A-Za-z0-9._/-]+\\.test\\.tsx?$")` | no |
 *
 * The pattern requires the character class immediately after the anchor, so
 * a group between them hides it, and no `new RegExp(…)` form is a regex
 * literal at all. It also reads **`scripts/` only, one level deep**: both
 * producers live there today, but "the producer nobody has written yet" is
 * not bound to that directory, and one under `lib/`, `bin/` or
 * `scripts/<subdir>/` is invisible. `scripts/` currently holds 79 `.ts`
 * files and no subdirectory containing one, so the depth limit costs
 * nothing today and would cost silently.
 *
 * **Widening the regex is not the fix and was declined deliberately.** A
 * text scan for a semantic property has no closed form; a looser pattern
 * buys false positives on every file that mentions a test path, and a
 * check that cries wolf is uninstalled by the third person it stops. The
 * honest statement is that this case raises the cost of the copy and does
 * not make it impossible, and that is written here rather than implied by
 * a test name — which is the only reason the gaps are discoverable at all.
 *
 * ## The cheapest wrong fix, named
 *
 * Copy `const SAFE_TEST_PATH = /…/` into the second script. Every
 * behavioural case below goes green under it. The two that do not are the
 * identity case and the population scan — which is exactly why a
 * behaviour-only version of this file would have been worth very little.
 *
 * ## What was broken to prove it, run and counted
 *
 * | Row | Predicted | Measured | The input on which mutant and original differ |
 * |---|---|---|---|
 * | **baseline** — unmutated | 6 pass, 0 fail | **6 pass, 0 fail** | — |
 * | `refuseUnsafePaths` returns `{ ok: true, unsafe: [] }` always — the pre-fix producer | 3 | **3 of 6** | the list `["test/odd name.test.ts"]`: the original refuses, the mutant prints it into a shell command |
 * | refuse changed to filter — drop the unsafe entries and print the rest | 2 | **1 of 6** | a fixture whose only selected reader is `test/odd name.test.ts`: the original prints nothing, the mutant prints a selection with that file quietly missing |
 * | the pattern copied into `scripts/text-dependents.ts` instead of imported | 2 | **2 of 6** | no runtime input at all — the identity case and the population scan are the only things that can see it, which is the point |
 *
 * The second row came in one under its prediction, and the miss is
 * instructive rather than cosmetic: filtering instead of refusing is a
 * change to the CLI and not to `refuseUnsafePaths`, so the three
 * function-level cases are structurally unable to see it. **Only the
 * end-to-end case can**, which is the whole reason it is here and the
 * reason a version of this file written entirely against the exported
 * function would have been worth very little.
 *
 * None is left in the tree; all were run and reverted, and
 * `scripts/text-dependents.ts` was confirmed byte-identical afterwards by
 * sha256 (`741edeac43908522…`).
