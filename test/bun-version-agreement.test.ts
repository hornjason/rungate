/**
 * Covers AC-1, AC-2, AC-3, AC-4, AC-5, AC-7 (#622).
 *
 * Nothing in this repository pinned the Bun version. Local was 1.3.14, CI's
 * `bun-version: "latest"` resolved to 1.4.3, and `release.yml` carried a third
 * spelling — a literal `"1.3.14"` nobody compared to anything. So the runtime
 * executing a given commit could change between two runs of that same commit,
 * with nothing in the diff to explain a new failure, and re-running a red job
 * was also a Bun upgrade.
 *
 * This is #621's shape one step down: there, three files named the project's
 * test command three ways; here, four workflow files named the runtime that
 * runs it. The remedy is the same — one declaration, one module that resolves
 * it, and a check that reads every position and refuses when they disagree.
 *
 * ## Why the extractor throws instead of returning nothing
 *
 * A check that reads four workflow files and compares what each says about Bun
 * is satisfied by finding nothing in all four — zero strings are trivially all
 * equal, and "no step names a moving tag" is true of a directory with no
 * setup-bun steps in it. That is
 * `.claude/rules/checks-must-be-able-to-fail.md`'s third shape, and it is how
 * this particular check is most likely to die: `ci.yml` and `gates.yml` are
 * GENERATED, so a template change renames a step and the reading quietly
 * shrinks. So `setupBunStepsIn` refuses a file with no `jobs:` block, the
 * directory scan refuses when no file uses the action at all, and every case
 * asserts its own coverage before asserting anything about what it read.
 *
 * ## Why the reading is parsed, not grepped
 *
 * AC-2 asks for a grep. A grep for `bun-version: "latest"` is a detector
 * narrower than what it detects — `bun-version: latest` unquoted, `'latest'`
 * single-quoted and a flow mapping all defeat it, and all three are valid
 * workflow syntax that GitHub honours. So the property is asserted against
 * `Bun.YAML.parse`d steps, and the raw text is used for one thing only: the
 * number of `oven-sh/setup-bun@` occurrences must equal the number of steps
 * the parse found. That is the instrument check, not a second decider — it
 * catches a parse that silently stopped seeing steps, which is the failure
 * mode a text search cannot have and a parser can.
