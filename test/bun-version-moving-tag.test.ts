/**
 * #932: the generator writes a value `contract-parity` then refuses.
 *
 * `isPinnedBunVersion` is this repository's definition of "a value that names
 * the same runtime tomorrow", and #622 left it with exactly one consumer —
 * `scripts/contract-parity.ts`, the CHECKER. `setupBunWith`, the GENERATOR,
 * never asked. So a consumer declaring `ci.bunVersion: "latest"` had an
 * unpinned runtime written into a managed workflow under a comment reading
 * *"From ci.bunVersion … Add one and re-scaffold"* — prose that describes a
 * successful declaration — and the only way to find out was to run the
 * checker, which then called that same line a violation.
 *
 * One predicate, two positions, opposite behaviour.
 *
 * ## The rung ordering this corrects
 *
 * Before: a project declaring NOTHING got the loud `UNPINNED:` block, and a
 * project declaring `latest` got silence. Declaring a moving tag was reported
 * strictly worse than declaring nothing at all, which inverts the thing
 * `.claude/rules/config-access.md` is about — a declaration that does not pin
 * is a state, and a state nothing reports is one nobody fixes.
 *
 * ## What is deliberately NOT asserted
 *
 * That the emitted version CHANGES. `MOVING_BUN_TAGS`' own doc comment says
 * declaring one "is a legitimate thing for a consumer to choose", so the
 * value still reaches CI verbatim and AC-7's no-silent-substitution property
 * holds at both rungs. What changes is that the file says what it is. The
 * verbatim-emission cases below exist to keep a future fix from "helping" by
 * substituting a pin the operator never asked for.
 *
 * It cost a measured red: hornjason/agentgrit#318. Its PR #313 read 1 under
 * local bun 1.3.14 and 3 under CI's 1.4.3 on an identical commit, because
 * `ci.bunVersion: "latest"` resolved differently on the two days.
