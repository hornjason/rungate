/**
 * CRC-N4 "no repeats", in the deployed adjudication path (#1586).
 *
 * `lib/ai-review-rounds.ts` has exported `carryKey`, `suppressRepeats`,
 * `priorFindings` and four siblings since #1351 and **nothing in production
 * called any of them**. This file binds the half that was missing: a gate
 * built in `lib/ai-review-suppression.ts`, handed to the reader by
 * `scripts/ai-review-findings.ts`, in the path `bunx rungate
 * ai-review-findings` runs.
 *
 * ## The acceptance, as amended on the issue
 *
 * Two cases, and the second one is the reason the first is safe:
 *
 * - **AS-1** a planted prior **ADVISORY** that still applies is not
 *   re-emitted, and a mutant that removes the subtraction turns that case
 *   red.
 * - **AS-2** a planted prior **BLOCKING** finding is still re-emitted and
 *   **still blocks**, and a mutant that removes the EXEMPTION proves the
 *   exemption is what did it — asserting on the resulting `blocked` and the
 *   surviving severities, not on a count. A count can stay right while the
 *   verdict moves, and the verdict is the thing that gates.
 *
 * The original wording asked only for the first. Built as written it
 * specifies a GREEN CHECK OVER A LIVE DEFECT, which was measured on the real
 * functions before any of this was written: a round-1 blocking finding,
 * re-reported on round 2 exactly as `buildReviewPrompt` instructs, run
 * through `suppressRepeats` with the ledger's keys, gives
 * `kept: 0, suppressed: 1, severity of what survives: []` → `blocked: false`
 * → `CLEAN`. `AS-6` below is that measurement, executed.
 *
 * ## Two halves that had to land together
 *
 * Supplying `lineTextFor` makes this round's keys SYMMETRIC with the
 * ledger's — before it, every key the adjudicator formed was `n:<line>` and
 * every key the ledger held was `t:<text>`, so the dedupe silently matched
 * nothing (`AS-5`). The blocking exemption is what stops that symmetry from
 * dropping a live finding. A tree carrying the first without the second is a
 * tree where a blocking repeat greens, so they are in one commit and `AS-6`
 * is the measurement that says why.
 *
 * ## The ordering guard
 *
 * The deployed job runs `ai-review-carry` → the reviewer →
 * `ai-review-persist`, **which writes this round into the ledger** →
 * `ai-review-run`. A gate fetching the ledger itself would read this round's
 * own findings as prior and report CLEAN forever. The snapshot is taken at
 * the carry step and carries `taken_before_round=<N>`; `AS-4` plants a
 * snapshot taken at PERSIST instead and asserts it is refused, with a mutant
 * that removes the guard suppressing this round against itself.
