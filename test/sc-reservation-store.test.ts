/**
 * Two concurrent branches cannot be handed the same SC id (#725).
 *
 * No SC id is claimed in this file. The ids this work needs have not been
 * allocated, and hand-writing one is the fourth of the four collisions of
 * 2026-10-19 — made by a session that had read the warning an hour earlier.
 * They are named in the PR for allocation instead.
 *
 * ## What the fixtures have to be, and why
 *
 * Every case here builds TWO real git repositories whose `specs/` exclude
 * each other's ids, and drives the real `allocateScNumber` against each. That
 * is the collision in the issue, reproduced: on branch A the allocator reads a
 * floor that does not contain B's claim and is internally consistent, on B the
 * same mirrored, and the collision exists only in the union.
 *
 * They are real `git init` repositories because `readScNamespace` shells out
 * to `git worktree list` and `git for-each-ref`; in a plain temp directory
 * both fail, and every assertion would then be a statement about git rather
 * than about the store (`test/sc-allocator-leg-provenance.test.ts` pays the
 * same second for the same reason).
 *
 * ## The positive control is the collision itself
 *
 * The first case asserts the two views allocate THE SAME NUMBER with no store
 * present. Without that, "the two numbers differ" is satisfied by two
 * fixtures that were never going to agree, and the case would reach its
 * assertion without the feature (#500). The collision has to exist before a
 * separation can be measured.
 *
 * ## Ids are computed, never spelled
 *
 * A literal `SC-<n>` below 9000 that no spec declares is a stray, and
 * `test/sc-fixture-namespace.test.ts` would report this file. Reserved blocks
 * are pairs of integers in JSON, which is one of the reasons the store is
 * JSON rather than Markdown.

/**
 * Does `readScReservations` agree with the JSON it read, entry by entry?
 *
 * Extracted from the live-store case by #1969 so the property survives an
 * EMPTY store. The store is a registry of ids in flight, and
 * `.claude/rules/parallel-sessions.md` tells every owner to delete their block
 * at merge — so "no blocks" is the correct resting state, and a reading taken
 * against it proves nothing. One helper, driven by a fixture that is always
 * populated and by the live file when it happens to be, rather than a reading
 * that is sometimes a check and sometimes a demand that the file not be tidy.
 *
 * Paired by INDEX, not by owner (#1542): the store is keyed by nothing, and a
 * branch holding ids in two namespaces declares two entries under one owner —
 * `.claude/rules/parallel-sessions.md` records `rg/filing-gate-four` holding
 * `FG-45..59` and `AR-20` as the incident the `namespace` field exists for.
 * Against such a store `find(b => b.owner === …)` returned the FIRST of the two
 * for both iterations and the second row asserted `"FG" === "AR"`, reporting
 * the reader as having rewritten a namespace it never touched. The same key
 * made the row vacuous from the other side: while every owner is unique the
 * lookup can only return the block the entry was taken from, so a reader that
 * rewrote EVERY namespace to `SC` would still be matched against a correctly
 * tagged copy of itself. Index pairing is what makes the mutation — forcing
 * `namespace: SC` inside `readScReservations` — land on the AR entry by name.
 *
 * Index pairing is sound because `readScReservations` builds its result with
 * `declared.map(...)` and sorts nothing (the only sort is on a local copy
 * inside `overlapFault`), and it is ASSERTED rather than assumed: the
 * owner/from/to agreement below is the order-preservation reading.
 *
 * Collected rather than thrown per row, so a failure names EVERY entry the
 * reader misread instead of only the first.

// ── #1363: the store holds more than one namespace ────────────────────────

/**
 * An `FG-`/`AR-` block declared here is not a claim on the SC ids of the same
 * numbers (#1363).
 *
 * The instance: `rg/filing-gate-four` held `FG-45..FG-59` and `AR-20` while
 * PR #1339 independently took `FG-45..FG-49` and `AR-20`. Neither diff
 * contained the other's ids, so neither PR's CI could see it. The rule says
 * to reserve a block before consuming an id; the store had no field in which
 * to say *which* ids, so the entry that follows the rule declares the SC ids
 * of the same numbers instead — and `allocateAgainstReservations` then hands
 * the owner an SC id from inside `45..60`, or throws once those are taken.
 *
 * ## What each case has to be able to fail on
 *
 * The cheapest wrong fix is **"ignore any block that carries a `namespace`
 * field"**, which is not a namespace comparison at all — it is a presence
 * check wearing one. It satisfies every case about FG blocks being ignored
 * and every case about untagged blocks still counting, because those are the
 * only two shapes an unwary suite plants. `the CONTROL` below is the row it
 * fails: a block tagged `"SC"` EXPLICITLY must bind exactly as hard as one
 * with the field absent, and under the presence check it binds not at all.
 *
 * The ids here are two-digit FG/AR numbers and the SC ids are computed, so
 * nothing in this block spells an `SC-<n>` literal — see the file header.
