/**
 * Covers SC-1613..SC-1620 (HARNESS-STANDARD.md), #439.
 *
 * `contextDocs` was reported from a consumer project's session as a dead
 * config key. It was not dead — `gates/brief-assembler.ts` consumes it — and
 * what was actually wrong is worse than inert, because the key looked like it
 * worked. Three defects stacked in one twenty-line region:
 *
 *   1. Every entry starting with `/` or containing `..` was filtered out with
 *      no warning. The use case that prompted the report was declaring docs in
 *      another project, which is an absolute path. Refusing was
 *      indistinguishable from there being nothing to refuse.
 *   2. The config was read straight from `.claude/rungate.json`, so a project
 *      on the directory layout got nothing regardless of the filter.
 *   3. `catch { return null }` turned a trailing comma into "no docs".
 *
 * A fourth surfaced on the way: the schema declared `contextDocs` as an
 * OBJECT only, while the consumer and its own tests supported the array form.
 * The contradiction was invisible because the consumer parsed the file itself
 * and never reached the validator.
