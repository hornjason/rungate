/**
 * #140: IssueCloseGuard must not permit a close it was unable to check.
 *
 * The guard's blocking branch lived inside a `try` whose `catch {}` was empty:
 *
 *     try {
 *       const github = createGitHubClient();
 *       const issueData = await getIssue(github, repo, issueNum);
 *       if (labelNames.includes('p1-ship-next') || ...) block(...);
 *     } catch {}
 *     console.log('WARNING: ...');
 *     process.exit(0);
 *
 * So anything throwing before `block()` — a missing token (#139), a rate
 * limit, a network blip — fell through to a warning and exit 0. Measured on
 * 2026-10-06: the same close of the same p1-labelled issue blocked with
 * GITHUB_TOKEN set and was waved through without it. The environment of the
 * day was the second one.
 *
 * `.claude/rules/checks-must-be-able-to-fail.md` names this shape directly:
 * fail-open error handling in a guard, where the `catch` resolves to "no
 * problem found".
 *
 * These drive the real hook as a subprocess, the way Claude Code runs it, so
 * the thing under test is the decision that actually reaches the caller. No
 * network: every case here is one the guard cannot reach GitHub for, which is
 * exactly the condition being tested.

/**
 * #143: the guard's repository fallback was the literal `hornjason/pai-config`
 * — a different repository from the one this harness closes issues in. A close
 * that named no repo (`gh issue close 23`) was therefore vetted against
 * whatever issue 23 happens to be in pai-config: its labels, its ship state,
 * none of it related to the issue actually being closed. Protected and
 * unprotected both decided by an unrelated ticket.
 *
 * The fix is to require an explicit repository and refuse when there is none.
 * A bare `gh issue close 23` now blocks; that is the accepted cost, and it is
 * the correct side to fail on — `.claude/rules/checks-must-be-able-to-fail.md`
 * is the whole reason this guard stopped guessing in the first place.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT done: deriving the repo from the working directory's git
 * remote. PR #154 tried that and security review found two HIGH bypasses in
 * it. cwd-derivation is a new parser surface on an authorization boundary
 * (`cd` inside a compound command, `gh repo set-default`, remote URL host
 * parsing), and the guard already has one parser surface too many (#144).
