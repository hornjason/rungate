/**
 * Covers #1356 — nothing supplied the changed-file list the adjudicator
 * accepts, so the scope reading was `NOT_SUPPLIED` on every run that has ever
 * executed and the demotion has never fired.
 *
 * ## What this issue is NOT, and the split is deliberate
 *
 * **Phase 1, here: the generated job writes the list and hands it over.**
 * Every property that can be witnessed from this tree is witnessed here — the
 * step's position, where it writes, what it does when `git diff` fails, and
 * that the path reaching the adjudicator is the same constant the writer
 * used.
 *
 * **Phase 2, no longer here and no longer unobservable:
 * `test/ai-review-changed-files-e2e.test.ts`.** This file used to carry a
 * paragraph explaining that the end-to-end case could not be written — the
 * generated step runs `bunx rungate@<generating version>`, the published
 * adjudicator took one positional, so a second was a no-op and a case
 * asserting it would go green having observed nothing.
 *
 * `v0.8.3` inverted that premise and the paragraph is deleted rather than
 * reworded (#1567). Rewording would have kept the claim — *unobservable
 * until a release carries the reading half* — intact while its premise had
 * flipped, and the file would have gone on reading as current. The honest
 * change is that the case exists now, so the test says it and this comment
 * does not need to.
 *
 * This file's own claim is unchanged and still narrow: the input exists, is
 * taken from the right tree, and is handed over correctly. Neither file
 * claims an observation of a production run.
 *
 * ## Why the list must come from the RESTORED tree
 *
 * The reviewer can write to the checkout — that is why the drift step exists.
 * A diff taken after the review is a diff the subject of the review had an
 * opportunity to edit. `test/ai-review-finding-scope.test.ts` AC-10 holds the
 * adjudicator to never computing it; CF-1 here holds the JOB to taking it
 * before the reviewer runs.
