/**
 * PROJECT-STATE.md is how a human finds out where the project is. Nothing
 * made it go red when it stopped being true.
 *
 * `.git/hooks/pre-commit` runs `scripts/update-project-state.ts` on every
 * commit and printed `✅ Updated PROJECT-STATE.md` every time. That script
 * only RE-RENDERS the markdown from `project-state.json`; writing session
 * content is the DA's job (CLAUDE.md: "PROJECT-STATE.md at milestones, and
 * the DA writes it"). On 2026-10-12 eight commits and four merges went by
 * reporting success while the latest recorded session stayed at 38, dated
 * the previous day.
 *
 * So the state file was stale, the tool said it was fine, and the only thing
 * that would have caught it was somebody remembering. This is that, made
 * mechanical.
 *
 * ## What is and is not automated here
 *
 * The NARRATIVE cannot be generated — which four defects were the same class,
 * what the lesson was, what policy changed. That is the content worth having
 * and a machine cannot write it.
 *
 * Noticing it is MISSING is pure mechanism: compare the merges on `main`
 * against what the latest session entry accounts for. So this refuses rather
 * than auto-writes, which is the same choice every other guard here makes —
 * a generated placeholder would satisfy the check and tell the reader
 * nothing, which is strictly worse than the staleness it replaced.
