/**
 * #804 — the suite's margin against its budget, read from a report.
 *
 * `timeoutProximityViolations` and `durationCoverageViolations` have been
 * correct since #621 and have never run against this repository's suite. The
 * population they read comes from `SUITE_JUNIT_REPORT`, and measured on
 * `1222742b` that variable appears five times in the tree, all five inside
 * `test/test-timeout-population.test.ts` — four in the function that reads it
 * and one in the env of that file's own mutant spawn. Nothing else sets it,
 * and `.github/workflows/ci.yml:76` ran the suite with no reporter, so both
 * of its live cases printed UNMEASURED and passed on every run.
 *
 * So the thing under test here is NOT a new comparison. It is the composition
 * — one budget, N reports, both existing readings, one refusal — and most of
 * these cases are about the ways a composition can report nothing while
 * looking like it reported success.
 *
 * ## What this does NOT do, said here rather than left as an omission
 *
 * It does not wire the reading into CI, so #804 is not closed by it. The
 * obvious wiring is `[test.reporter] junit = "junit.xml"` in `bunfig.toml`,
 * which is MEASURED to work on bun 1.3.14 and needs no command-line flag —
 * and it has a hazard worth stating before anyone reaches for it: several
 * suites in `test/` spawn `bun test` as a subprocess with the repository as
 * cwd, so every one of those nested runs inherits the declaration, writes the
 * same relative path, and the LAST writer wins. A top-level run of 15,000
 * cases can end with a three-case report on disk, and a three-case report is
 * not empty — `examined === 0` below would not catch it. Where the report is
 * written is the decision #804 still needs.
 *
 * ## The cheapest wrong fix, named before the repair
 *
 * **Exit 0 when the report is missing.** It is the 5pm repair for the first
 * red this produces — the job cannot find the file, so stop failing on it —
 * and it reinstates the exact defect #804 is filed about: a reading that did
 * not happen, reported as one that passed. `AC-4` and `AC-9` are red under
 * it, non-vacuously: `AC-4` asserts the UNMEASURED reading refuses, and
 * `AC-9` observes the real script's exit status against a mutant whose
 * `REFUSE_EXIT` is zero.
 *
 * ## What was broken to prove these can fail
 *
 * See the table in `specs/HARNESS-STANDARD.md` beside this issue's criteria,
 * and the battery note in the pull request. Counts were predicted before the
 * battery ran and the baseline row was read first.
