/**
 * What the board is allowed to say (#1647).
 *
 * ## What was broken to prove these can fail
 *
 * Run `bash /tmp/rg-bm-battery/battery.sh`, 2026-10-28, against a 28-pass
 * baseline. Every row replaces one line in `lib/board-mirror.ts`:
 *
 *   baseline                                 0 red / 28 pass
 *   cap mirrorText at 6 with `+N more`       1 red / 27 pass
 *   criteriaNamedBy in mention order         1 red / 27 pass
 *   phaseOf without the `\b`                 1 red / 27 pass
 *   openFrontier ignores issue state         2 red / 26 pass
 *   isReady drops `phase !== frontier`       2 red / 26 pass
 *   isReady drops `frontier === null`        1 red / 27 pass
 *   isReady drops the assignee test          1 red / 27 pass
 *   restored                                 0 red / 28 pass
 *
 * **Two of those rows were GREEN on the first run and are the reason the
 * battery was worth running.** `phaseOf` without the boundary changed
 * nothing because the case said `"Subphase 3"`, and the pattern is
 * case-sensitive — it never matched that string with or without the `\b`, so
 * the case could not disagree. And removing the null-phase guard changed
 * nothing because `null !== frontier` already carried it: two lines, one
 * decider, no behavioural test able to say which was live. The guard was
 * deleted rather than tested, and the one case it genuinely earns — both
 * sides null — was added.
 *
 * The first row is not hypothetical either. The cap SHIPPED, with a docblock saying
 * the overflow branch was unreachable because the widest issue named six ids,
 * and the first live run produced
 * `CRC-E1 CRC-E2 CRC-E3 CRC-E4 CRC-E5 CRC-E6 +3 more` for #1437, which names
 * nine. The bound was never measured; it was asserted in a comment. The case
 * below is that issue's real id list.
 *
 * The `isReady` rows are the ones worth having. An earlier version returned
 * "unblocked and unassigned", which made 36 of 46 open issues Ready because
 * this repository has almost no dependency edges — a lane holding the whole
 * backlog, answering "what can I pick up" with "anything".
