/**
 * Covers the structural integrity of
 * `specs/RULE-LIFECYCLE-AND-CONTEXT-BUDGET-SPEC.md` (#544).
 *
 * The spec's 19 behavioural criteria (SC-1930..SC-1948) are NOT covered here.
 * Nothing implements them yet, and a test that asserts an unimplemented
 * criterion either fails the suite or — far worse — passes vacuously and
 * certifies work that was never done. `.claude/rules/checks-must-be-able-to-
 * fail.md` names that third shape by name, and #209 established the honest
 * alternative: an unimplemented criterion emits `test.todo`, never a swallowed
 * pass.
 *
 * What IS asserted here is everything about the spec document that can be
 * checked today: that its ids are unique, inside the range reserved for it,
 * declared in a position `sync-sc-status.ts` can read, and that the two
 * statements the design depends on — `paths` being the only load-time lever,
 * and the budget being concurrent-load rather than a count — are actually in
 * the document rather than only in an issue comment.
 *
 * To see this fail: renumber one SC to collide with another, or delete the
 * concurrent-load sentence from the spec body.
