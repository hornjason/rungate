/**
 * #590 — proving `scripts/check-state-record-closes.ts` can refuse.
 *
 * Every negative case runs TWICE: once against the real script, and once
 * against a mutant copy whose single exported exit-code constant is set to 0.
 * The second run is the evidence. A test that only asserts "exit code != 0"
 * cannot tell a refusal from a crash, a typo, or a module-resolution failure
 * — and `.claude/rules/checks-must-be-able-to-fail.md` counts five shipped
 * bugs of exactly that shape in one day.
 *
 * The mutant also has to be observed RUNNING, not merely exiting 0: a script
 * that died before reaching the comparison exits 0 under no circumstances,
 * but a script whose import failed looks identical to one that found nothing.
 * So each case asserts the mutant still printed the refusal it declined to
 * act on.
 *
 * `test/rook-review-scope.test.ts` is the worked example this copies.
 *
 * ## What was broken to prove it — #590
 *
 * Run and counted rather than asserted, over this file plus
 * `test/closing-keywords.test.ts` (59 tests at the time). Every count was
 * predicted before the battery ran, as
 * `.claude/rules/checks-must-be-able-to-fail.md` requires, and each mutant
 * was checked against an input on which it and the original differ.
 *
 * | Mutation | Predicted | Red |
 * |---|---|---|
 * | `stateRecordCloseViolations` short-circuited to `return []` | 12 | **13** |
 * | the colon separator removed — `fixed: #586` stops matching | 7 | 7 |
 * | the `\b` in front of the keyword stem removed | 1 | 1 |
 * | the declared-but-unclosed loop short-circuited | 3 | 3 |
 * | `BANKED` in the live-record case emptied | 1 | 1 |
 *
 * The first row came back one HIGH, and the extra red is "the same issue
 * closed twice in two texts is one finding" — a case that genuinely depends
 * on the mutated behaviour and that the prediction simply failed to
 * enumerate, not a crashing mutant. Every other case touching the comparison
 * went red, which is the discriminator that section prescribes.
 *
 * The colon row does NOT include the live-record case. The live record is
 * the only fixture nobody wrote, and it is blind to a narrowing of the
 * detector — it can only witness a close the detector still sees. The form
 * table is the thing holding that line.
 *
 * **The last two rows are history, not current readings.** #605 deleted the
 * declared-but-unclosed loop, and `BANKED` is `[]` on this tree, so neither
 * mutation exists to apply any more. They are kept because a row that was
 * true of a tree somebody can check out is evidence about how the file got
 * here; see the #605 table below for what holds those lines now.
 *
 * ## What was broken to prove it — #605
 *
 * Re-measured on this tree over this file plus `test/closing-keywords.test.ts`
 * (78 tests). Every count was predicted before the battery ran, the BASELINE
 * row was read before any mutation row, and before each count was recorded
 * an input was named and RUN on which the mutant and the original differ.
 *
 * | Row | Predicted | Measured | The input on which mutant and original differ |
 * |---|---|---|---|
 * | **baseline** — unmutated | 78 pass, 0 fail | **78 pass, 0 fail** | — |
 * | `declaredClosureViolations` short-circuited to `return []` — the mutation #605 AC-4 asks for | 10 | **10 of 78** | `declaredClosureViolations([640], {states:{640:"OPEN"}})`: original returns one refusal naming #640, mutant returns `[]` |
 * | the keyword -> undeclared loop short-circuited | 7 | **7 of 78** | `keywordCloseViolations` over `"Filed and not fixed: #586"` with nothing declared: original returns one refusal, mutant returns `[]` |
 * | UNMEASURED defaulted to CLOSED — *Silent Default Substitution* | 4 | **4 of 78** | `declaredClosureViolations([662], null)`: original refuses naming UNMEASURED, mutant returns `[]` |
 * | the cheapest wrong fix: the live record's five declared ids appended to `BANKED` | 1 | **1 of 78** | the live `project-state.json`: the staleness arm names all five as banked ids the record does not produce |
 * | the pre-#605 conflation reinstated — the declared-but-unclosed loop put back | 7 | **7 of 78** | the AC-1 fixture (`declared: [662]`, a summary with no keyword in it): original returns `[]`, mutant returns *"the record declares #662 closed, but no closing keyword … will make GitHub close it"* |
 *
 * **Two rows are the ones to read.**
 *
 * The last row is the only one that measures the new cases against the
 * DEFECT rather than against a reconstruction of something else, and AC-1 —
 * *a declared id that is CLOSED on GitHub passes with no keyword anywhere* —
 * is in it. That case is red on the pre-#605 behaviour and green on this
 * tree, which is what makes it a witness of the fix rather than a case that
 * sits beside it.
 *
 * The `BANKED` row is the fifth shape — *a case that goes green under the
 * wrong fix* — measured rather than argued. The 5pm repair for any refusal
 * the live-record case produces is to append the id to `BANKED`: one array
 * element, suite green, distinction buried. **It does not work here**, for
 * two independent reasons. The bank is now a two-way ratchet, so an entry
 * the live record does not actually produce is itself a failure (that is
 * the 1). And the #605 cases are unreachable from it in any case: they are
 * synthetic records with ids of their own, and `BANKED` is read in exactly
 * one place, against the live file. Appending an id cannot turn any #605
 * case from red to green, so none of them certifies the regression it was
 * written to block.
 *
 * The keyword row is the #605 AC-3 control: *the keyword -> undeclared
 * direction is unchanged and its existing cases still pass*. Seven cases
 * depend on it, and none of them is among the ten the declared-side row
 * reds — the two deciders have disjoint witnesses, which is the evidence
 * that they are two and not one wearing two names.
 *
 * A note on the keyword row's prediction, because the arithmetic matters
 * more than the appearance of having been right: the first number written
 * down was "≈6", which was a mis-addition of a list of seven enumerated
 * cases. The seven measured are exactly the seven enumerated, so the
 * enumeration — which is the prediction that does any work — matched.
 *
 * None of the five #605 mutations is left in the tree; all were run and
 * reverted, and `scripts/check-state-record-closes.ts`,
 * `test/closing-keywords.test.ts` and this file were confirmed
 * byte-identical to the measured source afterwards by `shasum -a 256`.
