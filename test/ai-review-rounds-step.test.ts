/**
 * The generated round-counting step, and its agreement with the library that
 * decides the same thing (#1168).
 *
 * Covers CRC-N1 (CODE-REVIEW-CONVERGENCE-SPEC.md).
 *
 * `AC-S1` binds the cap to the library's, `AC-S2` holds the bash and the
 * library to one at-cap decision, `AC-S3` makes an unreadable count red
 * rather than a first round, `AC-S4` finds the step in the COMMITTED
 * workflow, and `AC-S5` reads the at-cap branch asking the reviewer for an
 * approach assessment and refusing silence. That conjunction is the
 * criterion. No new assertion is added for the id.
 *
 * `lib/ai-review-rounds.ts` is the source of truth and it delegates the
 * budget arithmetic to `reReviewDecision` in `lib/security-verdict.ts`.
 * `lib/scaffold/ai-review-step.ts` cannot import it — a relative import
 * added to that file resolves to nothing inside the `mkdtemp` directory the
 * ai-review mutation batteries copy it into, so the mutant fails to LOAD and
 * every case comparing real against mutant goes red while witnessing nothing
 * (`.claude/rules/self-referential-tests.md`, Tier 1, last row). The rule's
 * own remedy for a file that must stay import-free is an agreement
 * assertion, and this file is it.
 *
 *  - AC-S1  the two cap literals equal the library's
 *  - AC-S2  the generated bash agrees with the library over one input matrix
 *  - AC-S3  the refusal is routed through one constant, and it can fail
 *  - AC-S4  the step is in the committed workflow, with the permission it needs
 *  - AC-S5  nothing the branch under review wrote reaches the prompt
 *  - AC-S8  the query carries no `status=` term, and must not grow one

 * The defect this block exists for, as it shipped in #1236.
 *
 * A pull request reaches round 4 carrying an unfixed blocking finding from
 * round 2. The prompt told the reviewer the finding was "carried forward for
 * you" — nothing carried it — and told it not to use a blocking severity. The
 * required check went green over a live finding.
 *
 * So two properties, and they are different in kind:
 *
 *  - the cap may not reach the BLOCKING DECISION. Asserted behaviourally,
 *    against the committed verdict step, with a mutant to show the case is
 *    not vacuous.
 *  - the cap may not tell the REVIEWER to withhold a blocking severity, and
 *    the prompt may not promise an enforcement nothing performs. Asserted
 *    over the prompt text, which is the only instruction the reviewer gets.
