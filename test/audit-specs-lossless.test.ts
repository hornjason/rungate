/**
 * Covers SC-1587..SC-1595 (SCAFFOLD-DECOMPOSITION-SPEC.md), #426.
 *
 * `bun bin/rungate.ts scaffold . --fix` is the documented way to take a
 * harness update. It rewrote `specs/HARNESS-GATES.md` on every run, and the
 * rewrite lost information:
 *
 *   - SC-1469: workflows/ship.js not contains [s.environments.prod.rebuild = 'PASS'] — a container that answers …
 *   + SC-1469: not contains [s.environments.prod.rebuild = 'PASS']
 *
 * The file the criterion is about and the entire rationale clause, deleted,
 * silently, under a summary line naming `ci.yml`.
 *
 * The proximate cause is `content-not-contains` in the matcher registry: it
 * accepted `must NOT contain` and `has no` but not the `not contains` form —
 * which is the form `content-contains-compound`'s OWN example writes. So the
 * single-clause form of the documented grammar was unmatchable, SC-1469 was
 * classified unmatched, and `--fix` re-rendered it from a template that
 * carries neither a file nor prose.
 *
 * Two things are therefore fixed and both are driven from both sides here,
 * because fixing only the registry would leave the next unrecognised
 * structured form being silently rewritten:
 *
 *   1. the registry recognises the form, so the absence claim is ASSERTED
 *      rather than merely left alone — it had never run;
 *   2. `decideRewrite` refuses to rewrite anything already in the structured
 *      grammar, refuses any rewrite that would drop the file, and carries
 *      the rationale across when it does rewrite.
 *
 * The thing that makes this file a check rather than a line in a report is
 * the pairing: every case asserting a line survives sits beside one asserting
 * a genuinely unstructured line is still rewritten. An "it never rewrites
 * anything" fix has to fail here, which is AC-4 in the issue.

 *   - [ ] SC-9302: …                                <- the rest of the file,

 *
 * Three ids now appear twice in the document and one criterion has lost its
 * text — under a run that reported `kept: "no registry pattern was close
 * enough"` and `before === after` for all four. **The ledger says nothing was
 * touched and the file disagrees**, which is the whole of #586 arriving by a
 * different route than the one the issue describes.
 *
 * A whole-file comparison of run 1 against run 2 cannot see any of it: the
 * damage is done by the FIRST run and the second reproduces it exactly, so
 * `one === two` is true over a wrecked document. That is this repo's
 * "assertions that hold vacuously" shape, and the AC's own metric — zero SC
 * statement lines differing between the runs — has it too. So the run-1/run-2
