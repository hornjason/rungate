/**
 * Covers SC-828, SC-830, SC-831 (HARNESS-STANDARD.md).
 * Covers SC-1419, SC-1420, SC-1421, SC-1422 (HARNESS-STANDARD.md) — #407.
 * Covers SC-1647..SC-1652 (HARNESS-STANDARD.md) — #445.
 *
 * #445 — the postflight refused `v0.4.0`, which had published, and said *the
 * publish step did not take effect* while adding that it had waited long
 * enough for this not to be propagation. It had not established either
 * claim. Both releases this project has ever cut are recorded as failures.
 * The fix is not a longer wait: it is reading `versions` rather than a
 * dist-tag, and reporting UNMEASURED where a cause was being asserted.
 *
 * #364 — rungate had no publish step. npm served `0.2.1` while `main` was 741
 * commits past it, so every mutation count and gate measurement in
 * `SUCCESS.md` described software no consumer could install.
 *
 * The issue named the way this fix most likely ships broken, and it is the
 * shape `.claude/rules/checks-must-be-able-to-fail.md` opens with:
 *
 *   > A publish job that exits 0 because npm rejected a duplicate version is
 *   > exactly the "could not measure reads as nothing wrong" shape.
 *
 * So the suite is in three parts, and the second two matter more than the
 * first: the decision (unit), the SCRIPT (spawned, and spawned again as a
 * mutant with its refusal exit zeroed), and the WORKFLOW FILE itself — a
 * guard the pipeline never calls, or calls behind a `continue-on-error`, is
 * the decorative check this repo keeps finding.

/**
 * #472 — the postflight's budget was a guess against an asynchronous pipeline
 * that announces itself.
 *
 * Three consecutive releases published successfully and were reported as
 * failures: 0.3.0, 0.4.0, 0.4.1. #407 widened the budget; #445 fixed the
 * wording. Both left the mechanism alone — a blind poll of an eventually
 * consistent document. 0.4.1 missed by 48 seconds:
 *
 * | Event | Time (UTC) |
 * |---|---|
 * | `npm publish` returns `+ rungate@0.4.1` | 12:41:09 |
 * | postflight gives up, 25 reads over 120s | 12:43:10 |
 * | the registry serves 0.4.1 | 12:43:58 |
 *
 * Raising the budget to 180s catches that one and says nothing about the
 * next, which is the objection #445 raised against the budget it replaced.
 *
 * The evidence was already on the page. npm prints `+ rungate@0.4.1` — a
 * receipt written synchronously at publish time — and in the same output
 * says the packument will lag. The fix reads the receipt.
 *
 * **Two deciders, each with an input only it can reach.** The receipt is the
 * only thing that sees a publish npm never accepted while the registry still
 * serves an older version; the packument is the only thing that sees a
 * receipt for a version that never landed. The cases below are written as
 * pairs for exactly that reason.
 *
 * What was broken to prove it, run and counted rather than asserted, over
 * `test/release-guard.test.ts` (69 tests):
 *
 * | Mutation | Red | Predicted |
 * |---|---|---|
 * | `receipt` nulled on entry to `postflightDecision` — #472 restored | 5 | 5 |
 * | the PROPAGATION PENDING branch removed | 1 | 1 |
 * | the registry consulted BEFORE the receipt | 3 | 1 |
 * | the receipt regex unanchored from the start of a line | 1 | 1 |
 * | an unreadable `--publish-log` swallowed instead of refused | 1 | 1 |
 * | `propagationWarned` dropped from the waiver condition | 1 | 1 |
 * | the ANSI strip removed from the receipt parser | 1 | 1 |
 *
 * None is left in the tree; all were run and reverted. The last two rows are
 * the security review's findings on the first commit, and the first row rose
 * from 4 to 5 because one more case now exercises the receipt path.
 *
 * The ordering row is an impure mutation and the extra two reds are
 * collateral, not coverage: it was performed by returning early with the
 * message `"early"`, which also destroys the two cases that assert what a
 * confirmed release SAYS. The ordering property itself is held by exactly
 * one case — `no receipt refuses EVEN WHEN the registry serves the version`
 * — which is the predicted number. Recorded rather than quietly rounded,
 * because a row whose count comes from the wrong cases is how a mutation
 * battery starts certifying itself.

 * #1563 — the step title asserted the reading its own message withheld.
 *
 * On `v0.8.3` the postflight exited 0 and printed, verbatim:
 *
 *   postflight OK: PROPAGATION PENDING — npm accepted rungate@0.8.3 and the
 *   registry is not serving it yet after 25 reads over 120s. This is NOT a
 *   confirmed read of the registry; it is the publish receipt plus npm's own
 *   stat…
 *
 * Two independent reads outside CI agreed with that message and contradicted
 * the step's name, *"Postflight — the registry actually serves this
 * version"*: `npm view rungate version --prefer-online` returned `0.8.2` and
 * `GET registry.npmjs.org/rungate` carried `dist-tags.latest: 0.8.2` with
 * `0.8.3` absent.
 *
 * **`postflightDecision` returns `confirmed` for two different readings**, and
 * only one of them is a registry read. They share an exit code, a step
 * conclusion and — before this — a step name, so the only place they differed
 * was a 5.7 MB log body. That is the sixth shape in
 * `.claude/rules/checks-must-be-able-to-fail.md` inverted: two mechanisms, one
 * observable, and the observable asserts the stronger of them.
 *
 * **Why the title moved rather than the reading.** The alternative fix is to
 * make the step genuinely take the reading it claimed. It cannot: the
 * packument is CDN-fronted and eventually consistent, `v0.8.1` took about 16
 * minutes and `POSTFLIGHT_BUDGET_MS` is 120s. Waiting longer is the fix #407
 * already shipped and #445 recorded as *a bigger guess rather than a different
 * mechanism*, and failing instead is how 0.3.0, 0.4.0 and 0.4.1 were all
 * recorded as failed releases. The reading is genuinely not available at that
 * point in the job, measured four times.
 *
 * So the criterion is NOT "the title is accurate", which is unfalsifiable
 * prose. It is that **the two confirmed outcomes are distinguishable without
 * opening the log**: one annotation each, carrying different verdicts, on a
 * channel GitHub renders in the run summary beside the title.
 *
 * What was broken to prove it, run and counted rather than asserted, over
 * `test/release-guard.test.ts` (75 tests, baseline 0 red):
 *
 * | Mutation | Red | Predicted |
 * |---|---|---|
 * | the step name put back to *"the registry actually serves this version"* | 1 | 1 |
 * | the PROPAGATION PENDING branch labelled `REGISTRY SERVES` — the defect itself | 3 | 3 |
 * | the annotation computed in the script and never printed | 2 | 2 |
 * | `escapeAnnotation` dropped from the message | 1 | 1 |
 * | the severity hardcoded to `notice` instead of derived from `outcome` | 2 | 2 |
 *
 * None is left in the tree; all were run and reverted. The membership was
 * predicted alongside the counts and matched in every row — a battery that
 * only predicts totals cannot tell a case that caught the mutation from a
 * case that broke for its own reasons.
 *
 * The second row is the one that matters: it is this issue's exact defect
 * reintroduced one layer in. Retitling the step without it would leave both
 * readings sharing an exit code, a conclusion, a name AND an annotation,
 * which is the original complaint with a more careful title on it.
