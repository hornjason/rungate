/**
 * #1469: `ai-review` has to REPORT on a push to the default branch, and
 * adding the trigger alone turns one problem into a worse one.
 *
 * ## Why the trigger
 *
 * `PROTECT-1` (`lib/branch-protection.ts`) reads a repository's protection
 * and refuses in both directions on a user-owned account whose required
 * contexts do not run on push:
 *
 * - `required_status_checks.strict = true` serialises every swarm's pull
 *   requests, measured at ~2.5 min per PR on a real consumer, and merge
 *   queues are unavailable on a user-owned repo.
 * - `strict = false` is refused as a RECOMMENDATION while any required
 *   context is missing from `push:` to the default branch, because push-CI
 *   is the only thing left that catches the semantic conflict.
 *
 * Measured on this tree on 2026-10-24, with the exact calls:
 *
 *     readPushCi(<origin/main>, ["test","ai-review"], "main")
 *       -> { onPush: ["test"], missing: ["ai-review"] }
 *     readPushCi(<this branch>, ["test","ai-review"], "main")
 *       -> { onPush: ["test","ai-review"], missing: [] }
 *
 * and `gh api repos/hornjason/pai-harness/branches/main/protection` reports
 * `contexts: ["test","ai-review"]`, `strict: false`. So `ai-review` was the
 * single entry blocking the reading, which is what AC-3 below binds.
 *
 * **This file does not decide `strict`, and nothing here recommends it.**
 * Setting `strict: true` on 2026-10-23 reddened PROTECT-1 inside the managed
 * pre-push hook and refused every session's push, repo-wide, with no commit
 * anywhere to revert. That decision is the owner's; what this change does is
 * make it decidable.
 *
 * ## What the job can DO on a push: nothing, and that is MEASURED
 *
 * Read from `anthropics/claude-code-action` at the SHA
 * `lib/claude-code-action.ts` pins, the same way #867 established it for
 * `merge_group`: `parseGitHubContext()` in `src/github/context.ts` switches
 * on `context.eventName`, and the `default:` branch throws
 * `Unsupported event type: <name>`. The switch's arms at that SHA are
 * `issues`, `issue_comment`, `pull_request`, `pull_request_review`,
 * `pull_request_review_comment`, `workflow_dispatch`, `repository_dispatch`,
 * `schedule` and `workflow_run`. **`push` is not among them.**
 *
 * So this is #867's distinction, met a second time: an argument about what
 * the job can DO on an event is not an argument about whether it REPORTS on
 * one. The job reports. It annotates `::warning` and names the state
 * UNMEASURED, because nothing read the commit.
 *
 * ## The failure mode this file is mostly about
 *
 * A `push` payload has no `github.event.pull_request`, so every binding that
 * reads one resolves to the empty string. Three steps refuse on that and two
 * of the three refuse with `AI_REVIEW_REQUIRED_EXIT`:
 *
 * | Step | Before this change, on a push | After |
 * |---|---|---|
 * | restore untrusted paths | empty base ref -> refuse, job RED | says there is no base and exits 0 |
 * | count the review rounds | empty head ref -> refuse, job RED | blank round outputs, exits 0 |
 * | carry forward prior findings | UNMEASURED, naming a lookup that never applied | declares ABSENT |
 * | report whether the review ran | falls through to the action's outcome and refuses | its own branch, naming the event |
 * | persist the ledger | already exits 0 on an empty PR number | unchanged, asserted here |
 * | disarm auto-merge | already exits 0 when nothing was waived | unchanged, asserted here |
 * | record the changed paths | already exits 0 on an empty base remote | unchanged, asserted here |
 *
 * The last three rows are the point of auditing rather than patching: they
 * are steps that read a pull-request value and were already safe, and a case
 * that only exercised the four changed ones would be claiming an audit it
 * had not done. They are asserted by EXECUTION, not by reading the source.
 *
 * ## The cheapest wrong fix, named
 *
 * Give the restore step `|| github.ref_name` as a third alternative for its
 * base ref. One token, the refusal stops firing, and the step then fetches
 * `origin/<branch>` — a ref that may already have moved past the commit
 * being built — and overwrites the checkout's untrusted paths with it. The
 * step reports success having done something nobody asked for.
 *
 * Do the cases here survive it? **Yes, non-vacuously.** AC-4 asserts the
 * restore step exits 0 on a push *with no base ref supplied at all* and says
 * so in its annotation; under the wrong fix the expression would supply one
 * and the script would attempt a fetch against a remote that does not exist
 * in the fixture, which is non-zero. AC-10 additionally reads the committed
 * workflow and asserts the binding is still the two-alternative one.
 *
 * ## What was broken to prove it, predicted before the battery ran
 *
 * Over `test/ai-review-push-trigger.test.ts` +
 * `test/ai-review-merge-group.test.ts` + `test/merge-group-trigger.test.ts`
 * (43 tests). **The baseline row was read before any mutation row** — an
 * instrument that has stopped reporting takes the baseline down with it, and
 * that is the row nobody mutates anything to produce. `bun` writes its
 * summary to stderr, so the reader takes both streams.
 *
 * | Row | Predicted | Measured | The input on which mutant and original differ |
 * |---|---|---|---|
 * | **baseline** — unmutated | 43 pass, 0 fail | **43 pass, 0 fail** | — |
 * | M1: the `push: branches:` block removed from `lib/scaffold/steps.ts` | 3 | **3 of 43** | a generated tree: the original's `on:` block carries `push:` and `readPushCi` returns `missing: []`, the mutant's does not and returns `missing: ["ai-review"]` |
 * | M2: `aiReviewPushBranch` short-circuited to `return ""` | 7 | **8 of 43** | `AI_REVIEW_EVENT=push` into any of the four scripts: the restore script exits 0 on the original and refuses on the mutant, and `buildRestoreScript()` contains the test string once against zero times |
 *
 * **M1's set, named rather than counted:** the two AC-1 cases and AC-3. AC-2
 * stays GREEN on purpose — it reads this repository's COMMITTED workflow,
 * which a mutation of the generator does not touch, and that split is why
 * both cases exist. The AC-4..AC-10 cases drive the scripts and are
 * indifferent to the trigger.
 *
 * **M2 came back HIGH, and the extra red is the real kind.** The prediction
 * missed *"AC-8: the refusal is NARROW — any other value of the flag still
 * reports"*, on the belief that a push with the flag UNSET would fall
 * through to a route that warns and exits 0. Measured: it does not. With the
 * branch gone, `AI_REVIEW_EVENT=push` reaches the action-outcome reading and
 * refuses with *"The review action (#631) did not complete"* **whatever the
 * flag holds** — `push` and `pull_request` produce byte-identical stderr and
 * exit 1 under the mutant. So the fact that row records is that the branch
 * is load-bearing for the DEFAULT path and not only the flagged one: without
 * it every commit that lands reds `ai-review` on main, for a cause the job
 * did not measure. The mutant is not broken — 35 cases still pass, the file
 * parses, and every red is about the removed branch.
 *
 * Neither mutation is left in the tree; both were run and reverted, and
 * `lib/scaffold/steps.ts` and `lib/scaffold/ai-review-step.ts` were confirmed
 * byte-identical to the measured sources afterwards by sha256 — never by
 * `git checkout --`, which eats an uncommitted rewrite.
 *
 * ## What this does NOT establish
 *
 * - **That GitHub reaches any of it.** No push run of the new trigger exists
 *   until this merges; every case here runs the generated script directly
 *   with `AI_REVIEW_EVENT` set. That proves the script's behaviour and not
 *   that the runner hands it that event name. The escape is asserted one
 *   layer out, in AC-10, which reads the committed `env:` bindings.
 * - **That `ai-review` on push adds any safety.** It does not, and the
 *   generator's own comment says so: the semantic-conflict net PROTECT-1
 *   argues for is `test`, which has run on push since the first scaffold.
 *   This trigger makes a required context REPORT; it reviews nothing.
