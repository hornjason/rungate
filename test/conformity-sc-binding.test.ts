/**
 * SC-to-behaviour binding for the conformity engine (#209).
 *
 * Until this file existed, `extractSCs` matched only `- [ ]`, so every CHECKED
 * SC — the ones claiming to be done — was never collected and never asserted.
 * The handful that were collected ran inside `try { assertion(root) } catch {}`,
 * so even those could not fail. The suite reported 0 fail while asserting
 * nothing about 261 completed criteria.
 *
 * What was broken to prove these checks can fail, run and reverted:
 *   - restoring the `- \[ \]`-only regex in extractSCs turns the floor test and
 *     every checked-SC test in this file red (0 checked SCs collected)
 *   - re-wrapping the generated body in try/catch turns
 *     "assertion failures propagate" red
 *   - unchecking one `- [x] SC-` line in any spec turns the no-regression
 *     count test red
 *

 * It counted checked SCs the engine can build no assertion for, and read
 * that as debt: marked done, no assertion, therefore wishes. True at 54.
 * It stopped being true once the repo started writing criteria about
 * REFUSALS, because the registry's vocabulary — file-exists,
 * content-contains, count-threshold, json-field-equals — is claims about
 * the STATE OF THE TREE, and no state of a tree expresses "X refuses, and
 * says which of two things happened".
 *
 * 239 → 242 → 252 → 258 across #397, #398 and #399, every rise for criteria
 * covered by executed tests, and the only route down was to rewrite them as
 * weaker claims about file contents. The number was measuring the matcher's
 * vocabulary and being read as the project's honesty.
 *
 * `test/sc-binding-split.test.ts` carries both halves now, and the
 * replacement is strictly tighter rather than a ratchet deleted for green:
 * 154 unclaimed bounded above, plus the claimed-but-unbindable half bounded
 * in BOTH directions — 254 against the 258 this allowed when the split
 * landed, with the half that used to rise freely now pinned exactly. The
 * second number is banked in that file rather than quoted here; it went 100
 * -> 66 in #574, and a count repeated in two places is a count that drifts
 * in one of them.
 *
 * 300 -> 320 on 2026-11-07 (#1718). The sentence above says this number
 * "refuses only a collapse, never an honest criterion", and that was not
 * true of 300: the split's two halves summed to 297, but the LIVE unmatched
 * count was also 300, so the headroom over the thing it bounds was zero.
 * Ticking SC-2618 and SC-2619 — two honest criteria, each with a `proved-by:`
 * naming what ran — took it to 302 and reddened this. A backstop calibrated
 * to the live reading is a third equality ratchet wearing a `<=`, and the
 * two in `test/sc-binding-split.test.ts` are the ones that are supposed to
 * refuse a tick. 320 is 18 above the live 302 and 23 above the split's sum,
 * which is a margin stated here rather than a number that tracks the tree.
