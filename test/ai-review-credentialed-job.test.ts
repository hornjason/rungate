/**
 * ai-review-credentialed-job.test.ts — the reviewer that actually runs (#631).
 *
 * Covers AC-1, AC-2, AC-3, AC-6, AC-6b, and the `model pin` / `no conditional`
 * / `mode exclusivity` cases the issue's AC-7 and AC-8 name by pattern.
 *
 * #630 shipped the auth-detect step and the UNMEASURED branch for mode `none`.
 * It said nothing about the other three modes, so a repository WITH a
 * credential got a green "AI Review" check having reviewed nothing. This file
 * is about the steps that close that door: a SHA-pinned vertex auth step and a
 * SHA-pinned `anthropics/claude-code-action`, each credential reaching the
 * action only in its own mode, one pinned model, and a prompt that names the
 * findings payload through the module's own constants.
 *
 * ## Why the generated FILE and not only the builder
 *
 * Every AC here is a claim about `.github/workflows/ai-review.yml`, so the
 * fixture scaffolds a project and reads the file back through a YAML parser —
 * which is what GitHub does. Asserting on the builder's string alone would be
 * asserting that a template literal contains what the template literal
 * contains (`.claude/rules/checks-must-be-able-to-fail.md`, third shape), and
 * would not notice a block scalar that mangles the prompt.
 *
 * ## Why presence is asserted before anything is compared
 *
 * An absent step makes "no `if:` on the review step" vacuously true, and
 * deleting the step is the cheapest repair for a failing case — so it would
 * certify the regression it exists to catch (#518). Presence is its own
 * assertion in every block below.
 *
 * ## Why the interpolation cases MUTATE the module
 *
 * AC-6b says the prompt names the findings path and key by interpolating the
 * exported constants. `expect(prompt).toContain(AI_REVIEW_FINDINGS_PATH_VAR)` is
 * satisfied by a prompt with the value typed into it a second time — the
 * assertion passes over exactly the duplication the AC forbids. So the cases
 * build a copy of `lib/scaffold/ai-review-step.ts` with the constant changed,
 * import it from a temp directory, and require the rendered prompt to move
 * with it. The input on which the mutant and the original differ, named rather
 * than assumed: the constant's own value.
