/**
 * ai-review-workflow.test.ts — the generated `.github/workflows/ai-review.yml`
 * (#630, wave 2: AC-7 and AC-11).
 *
 * Wave 1 shipped `lib/scaffold/ai-review-step.ts` — the auth-detect step, and
 * the tests that RUN it. Nothing wrote it into a file. This is the file, and
 * the conformity check that executes the copy on disk.
 *
 * Covers AC-1, AC-2, AC-3 (the generated workflow) and AC-4, AC-5 (the
 * conformity case). AC-6 lives in `test/release-guard.test.ts`, beside the
 * tuple it is about.
 *
 * ## Why the job carries no `if:`, and why that is asserted after presence
 *
 * A job skipped by `if:` reports `skipped`, and a skipped required check can
 * be treated as satisfied — a green required check for a review that never
 * ran. `secrets` is not available in `if:` at any level either, so the mode is
 * resolved inside `run:`.
 *
 * The assertion for that is the fifth shape in
 * `.claude/rules/checks-must-be-able-to-fail.md` waiting to happen: if the job
 * is ABSENT, "the job mapping has no `if` key" is vacuously true, and the
 * cheapest repair for a failing case — delete the job — makes it go green over
 * exactly the regression it exists to catch (#518). So presence is established
 * first, in its own assertion, and the `if` comparison only runs after it.
 *
 * ## Why the conformity cases are driven over planted fixtures too
 *
 * `runAiReviewValidation` reads THIS repository's generated file, which is the
 * right thing for it to read and the wrong thing to prove a check with: one
 * tree, one verdict, and that verdict is green. The red half is planted —
 * a workflow with a job-level `if:`, a script that never warns, a script that
 * warns unconditionally — so every refusal the check can emit is observed
 * emitting.
 *
 * ## What was broken to prove these fail, run and counted rather than asserted
 *
 * Baselines: this file 21 pass / 0 fail; `bun test test/scaffold-conformity.test.ts
 * -t AIREVIEW-1` 1 pass / 0 fail. None of the mutations is left in the tree;
 * all were run and reverted, and both files were confirmed to return to their
 * baselines afterwards.
 *
 * | Mutation | Predicted | Measured |
 * |---|---|---|
 * | `.github/workflows/ai-review.yml` deleted — the cheapest wrong fix for a red AIREVIEW-1 | 1 red | **1 of 1** — *"absent while ci.yml is present"*, so the repair makes it redder |
 * | the `::warning` line stripped out of the on-disk script | 1 red | **1 of 1** — *"emitted 0 UNMEASURED warning annotation(s), expected exactly 1"* |
 * | a job-level `if:` planted on the on-disk `ai-review` job | 1 red | **1 of 1** — *"a job skipped by a condition reports `skipped`"* |
 * | the generator's tuple entry renamed to `ai-review.yaml` | 13 red | **13 of 21** — the 8 green are the planted-fixture cases, which never read the generator's output |
 *
 * The input on which mutant and original differ, named rather than assumed:
 * for the first three it is the bytes of this repository's own
 * `.github/workflows/ai-review.yml`; for the fourth it is the filename
 * `createCiWorkflows` writes, which is the one thing holding
 * `AI_REVIEW_WORKFLOW_FILE` (what `lib/conformity.ts` reads back) to the
 * literal in the tuple `test/release-guard.test.ts` pins.
