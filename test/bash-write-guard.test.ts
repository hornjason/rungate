/**
 * Covers #1120 — `lib/bash-write-guard.ts`.
 *
 * Two populations, and the second is the point. Witnesses prove the guard
 * refuses a write; CONTROLS prove it does not refuse everything, because a
 * check that refuses everything passes every witness ever written for it.
 *
 * The controls are not invented. F1-F4 are REAL commands from real work that
 * the old guard refused:
 *
 *   F1, F2  the session coordinating #1120, twice, trying to read this very
 *           file with `git show … | grep -nE "chmod|chflags"`
 *   F3      a peer staging a comparison copy of a hook under /tmp
 *   F4      `hornjason/pai-config#474` — the ONLY false positive ever
 *           recorded for this hook, recovered verbatim from the 2026-09-10
 *           transcript
 *
 * F5-F8 come from a sweep of 5,060 real commands extracted from this
 * machine's 35,040 transcripts — every Bash command ever run here that names
 * a protected artifact. F5's shape alone occurs 1,390 times.

/**
 * Covers #1239 — an escaped quote desynchronises the word scanner, the
 * redirect operator is swallowed with the rest of the word, and the write is
 * ALLOWed.
 *
 * ## Why this is a battery and not two witnesses
 *
 * The issue filed two spellings, both inside `$( )`. Enumerating the space
 * instead of asserting the filed shapes found **seven** executable bypasses
 * across **two** scanners, from one root cause: `indexOf` cannot tell `"`
 * from `\"`, so inside a double-quoted span the escaped quote is read as the
 * closing one. Three of the seven need no `$( )` at all —
 * `echo "x\"" > <protected>` is the shortest of them and nobody had written
 * it down.
 *
 * `.claude/rules/checks-must-be-able-to-fail.md`, seventh shape: a battery
 * that varies the guard while holding the input shape fixed cannot be wrong
 * about an input nobody wrote. So the redirect is held fixed at `> <target>`
 * — that is the thing under test — and the axis that varies is the QUOTING
 * of the word in front of it, which is where the defect lives.
 *
 * ## Why every row is executed
 *
 * The whole defence of the unterminated spellings is that they are not valid
 * bash. That is a claim about bash, so it is measured by bash rather than
 * asserted: each row is written to a file and run against a seeded victim,
 * and the row's `runs` column is the reading. A row that RUNS and is ALLOWed
 * is a bypass; a row that is inert is not, and this file deliberately
 * constrains the guard's answer for none of them.
 *
 * The payloads are JS string literals written to a file with `writeFileSync`
 * and handed to `bash <file>`. They are never interpolated through another
 * shell, which would eat the backslashes before either bash or the guard saw
 * them and leave the battery proving something about the fixture. `stderr` is
 * asserted empty on every row expected to run, so a fixture that arrived
 * mangled is visible rather than silently scored as inert.

 * ## What was broken to make these fail
 *
 * Nothing had to be broken. All four WITNESS rows below were ALLOWED by
 * `origin/main` (`e17bacf6`) and are refused here — run before the fix, with
 * the four CONTROL rows green in the same run, so the reds are the escape
 * and not a module that stopped loading.
 *
 * Two of the four are the spelling #1276's stopgap was written for, reached
 * by routes it does not cover: a heredoc, which had no body gate at all, and
 * a `.replace` whose replacement is not a literal, so the "is every absolute
 * literal scratch" question answers yes and the write still lands in the run
 * store. That is the class #1277 predicted and the reason the stopgap
 * labelled itself one.
 *
 * ## The population, enumerated rather than asserted to be unchanged
 *
 * Swept over this machine's transcripts — 23,905 files, 50,189 unique Bash
 * commands, 1,843 of them naming a protected artifact:
 *
 *     newly blocked   0
 *     newly allowed   2      both real `/tmp` fixture builds; see REVERSED above
 *
 * A `0` in the blocked column is the reading `.claude/rules/
 * checks-must-be-able-to-fail.md` calls an instrument reporting nothing, so
 * here is what the instrument DID see, at the level the change operates on.
 * Of 531 non-shell interpreter segments in that corpus:
 *
 *     exempt before   15        exempt after    7
 *     lost exemption  11        gained          3
 *     a carrying literal consumed by an expression      235
 *     a body that does not read as complete literals     10
 *     no literal carrying a protected artifact          182
 *
 * So the fragment mechanism is exercised 235 times by real commands, and in
 * every one of them `origin/main` already refused for another reason — which
 * is why the command-level column is 0 and why that 0 is not blindness. The
 * four witnesses are synthesised because no agent on this machine has yet
 * written the escape; that is the same position #1270 was in.

/**
 * #1371: the push security review of #1277, answered over three rounds, and
 * the reason each round needed the next one.
 *
 * ## Why these are written by hand
 *
 * #1277 swept 50,189 unique real commands and reported 0 newly blocked and 2
 * newly allowed. That sweep is sound and it is a REGRESSION control: it
 * proves the change did not break what people do. It is structurally
 * incapable of proving the guard cannot be walked around, because the inputs
 * that walk around it are absent from a historical corpus by construction —
 * an honest caller never writes them, which is exactly who they are worth
 * something to. Every row below is in that gap.
 *
 * ## The rounds, and what each one got wrong
 *
 * **Round 1** found that `targets.every(isScratchPath)` quantified over a set
 * filtered by `ALL_PROTECTED`, so a literal spelling no protected basename
 * was never asked anything. Two of its five witnesses were REGRESSIONS —
 * refused by `origin/main`, allowed by `643e3053`.
 *
 * **Round 2** was the AI review, and it found that `standsAlone` treated a
 * newline as the end of the expression: #1277's own headline witness came
 * back ALLOWED with one line break inserted before the `.replace`. A
 * detector a reformat defeats.
 *
 * **Round 3** found that round 1's repair had reintroduced the defect it was
 * the repair for, one layer in. `literalInProtectedTree` opened with
 * `if (!value.startsWith('/')) return false`, so `~/…`, `$HOME/…` and
 * `${HOME}/…` took a silent skip that the caller read as "not protected"
 * rather than "I could not place this". It also asked for the rebinding
 * question to be answered by POSITION rather than by delimiter.
 *
 * ## What decides it now, and why these five and not more
 *
 *     IN_LIVE_TREE      a literal resolving inside protectedTrees(), through
 *                       no name list, with `~`/`$HOME` expanded first
 *     CANNOT_PLACE      a path-shaped literal with an expansion we cannot
 *                       perform — fail closed, because a false "unplaceable"
 *                       costs a refused exemption and a false "elsewhere"
 *                       costs a bypass
 *     inWritePosition   a target must be a direct argument of a recognised
 *                       write call: a whitelist of POSITIONS, where an
 *                       unanticipated transform fails closed by not being a
 *                       recognised position
 *     standsAlone       nothing adjacent to the literal consumes it
 *
 * A sixth was asked for and is NOT shipped: case-folding the live-tree
 * comparison. The mutation battery refused to witness it — see
 * `placeLiteral` — because the resolution step already canonicalises case.
 *
 * `inWritePosition` subsumed two cheaper repairs that were in the branch and
 * are now gone: dropping `=`/`:` from `ARG_OPENS`, and the proposed drop of
 * `:` from `ARG_CLOSES`. Keeping either beside it would be two deciders
 * answering one question — and the measurement that proves they were is in
 * `ARG_OPENS`'s own docblock: with `inWritePosition` in place, restoring
 * `=` and `:` moves nothing at all.
 *
 * ## The population, re-swept
 *
 * All variants evaluated on ONE corpus, which is the control that makes the
 * comparison mean anything: 32,023 transcript files, 132,196 unique Bash
 * commands, 5,738 naming a protected artifact. That is 2.6x the file count
 * #1277 swept and its columns come out at ~2x #1277's throughout.
 *
 *     e17bacf6 -> 643e3053    newly blocked 0    newly allowed 4
 *     e17bacf6 -> this        newly blocked 0    newly allowed 4
 *     643e3053 -> this        newly blocked 0    newly allowed 0
 *
 *     exempt   e17bacf6 29    643e3053 14    round 2  13    this 12
 *
 * With five refusals stacked, the failure that costs us is no longer a
 * bypass — it is an exemption that silently never applies again, and every
 * refusal row stays green through exactly that. So `exempt > 0` is the
 * reading that matters most, the CONTROL rows below are the load-bearing
 * half of this block, and each new refusal is paired with one.
 *
 * One width was measured and REJECTED, and the number is the argument.
 * Treating a relative path-shaped literal as unplaceable costs 7 real
 * commands and takes the exemption population from 13 segments to 6, because
 * `'hornjason/pai-config'` and `'./lib/x.ts'` are slash-bearing and are not
 * paths. It does not even close the class it was widened for: `'.'` and
 * `'x'` carry no slash. `inWritePosition` is the closure that works, because
 * it asks only about the literals a write actually consumes.

// ── #1471: a quoted FINAL word kept its closing quote ────────────────────
//
// `endOfQuoted` returned a bare index. For a span closing at the very last
// character that index IS `s.length` — the same value an UNTERMINATED span
// returns — and the one caller that strips the quotes resolved the tie with
// `end === s.length ? s.length : end - 1`. A correctly closed final word
// took the unterminated branch and kept its closing quote.
//
// #1239's defect one level down: there `indexOf` could not tell `"` from
// `\"`; here `s.length` could not tell *closed at the end* from *never
// closed*. `.claude/rules/checks-must-be-able-to-fail.md` names the shape —
// one value is almost never specific to one mechanism. The fix is in
// `endOfQuoted`'s RETURN (`{ end, contentEnd }`), not at the three call
// sites: computing `terminated` locally at each would be three deciders
// over one question, and a mutation of any one would leave the others
// holding the case up.
//
// **The trailing space is not a control at the decision level.** #1471's
// table pairs each spelling with a spaced variant, and `segments()` TRIMS
// the trailing space — so by the time `decideBashWrite` sees them the two
// are the same string. The spaced rows below are asserted at `writeTargets`,
// where the difference is real; the decision-level witness uses the
// UNQUOTED spelling as its control instead.
