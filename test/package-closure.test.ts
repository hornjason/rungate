/**
 * Covers #446 — every relative import in a published file resolves to another
 * published file.
 *
 * The defect this exists for: `lib/conformity.ts` imported
 * `../scripts/split-spec` while `files[]` omitted it, through two releases.
 * Every suite in this repo resolved that path against the working tree and
 * went green; `bun add rungate && import "rungate/lib/conformity"` died on
 * import. The repo could not see the artifact it was shipping.
 *
 * What was broken to prove this can fail, run and counted rather than
 * asserted:
 *
 * | Mutation | Red of 13 |
 * |---|---|
 * | `scripts/split-spec.ts` removed from `files[]` | 1 — CLOSURE-1, naming conformity.ts and the path |
 * | `packageClosureViolations` short-circuited to `return []` | 2 — the planted-defect case and the real-source half of CLOSURE-4 |
 * | `relativeImports` short-circuited to `return []` | 6 — the same pair plus all four CLOSURE-5 import forms, which read the scanner directly |
 *
 * None is left in the tree; all were run and reverted, and the counts above
 * are measured rather than predicted — the third was expected to be 2.
 *
 * ## #484 — the same question, asked of runtime reads
 *
 * `0.4.1` was cut TO FIX #446 and still shipped `lib/conformity.ts` reading
 * `../config/matcher-registry.json` from a directory `files[]` never named,
 * because that is not an import. Three directories and seven call sites were
 * in that state. `files[]` now carries `config/`, `templates/` and
 * `specs/SPEC-TEMPLATE.md`; `workflows/` turned out NOT to need publishing,
 * and the check established that rather than anyone asserting it — the only
 * reader, `scripts/validate-workflow.ts`, is itself unpublished.
 *
 * Predicted before running, then measured, over 29 tests:
 *
 * | Mutation | Predicted | Red |
 * |---|---|---|
 * | `config/` dropped from `files[]` | 1 | 1 |
 * | `templates/` dropped | 1 | 1 |
 * | `specs/SPEC-TEMPLATE.md` dropped | 1 | 1 |
 * | `runtimeReads` short-circuited to `return []` | 8 | 8 |
 * | comment stripping removed (scan raw source) | 4 | **3** |
 * | `keepStringContents` dropped, so segments blank | 8 | 8 |
 *
 * **Two rows did not come back as predicted, and both were findings.**
 *
 * The first draft had the three `files[]` rows at **2 red, not 1**. CLOSURE-1
 * asserted the whole violation list, so it and CLOSURE-8 were the same
 * assertion over the same input — two tests, one question, and either could be
 * deleted with the other still holding the case up. CLOSURE-1 is now filtered
 * to imports and CLOSURE-8 to reads, so each has an input only it can reach.
 *
 * The comment row came back 3 where 4 was expected, and the missing one is the
 * live-tree case. This module's own docstring quotes the broken expression to
 * explain it, and scanning raw source reports that quote as a call — which is
 * exactly how the defect was found. But now that `config/` ships, the quoted
 * path RESOLVES to a published file, so the live tree can no longer witness
 * the bug at all. The three synthetic CLOSURE-7 cases are the only thing
 * standing between this scanner and #454's mistake, and that is the whole
 * argument for not deleting them as redundant with the live-tree check.
 *
 * ## Four findings from the push security review (CLOSURE-10)
 *
 * The first is the one worth reading, because of where it was found: **a
 * fail-open, in the commit that adds a section about fail-opens to
 * `.claude/rules/checks-must-be-able-to-fail.md`.**
 *
 * `unresolvedModuleRelativeJoins` was exported, unit-tested, and never called
 * by `packageClosureViolations`. The module docstring said unresolvable reads
 * were "NOT silently dropped" while the only path that produces violations
 * dropped all of them. The unit test asserted the counter WORKED. Nothing
 * asserted the counter was CONSULTED, and those are different claims.
 *
 * The other three, each now a case:
 *
 * - The tokenizer dropped `\` and the character after it under
 *   `keepStringContents`, so `"a\"b"` came back as the segment `ab`. Not a
 *   truncated answer — a different path, which the checker would then name in
 *   a violation. Such a segment is now unresolvable, and therefore reported.
 * - `join` is resolved by identifier, so `import { join as j }` was invisible.
 *   Refused outright rather than missed; the blind spot is narrow and the
 *   point is that entering it cannot be silent.
 * - `publishedFiles` walked `files[]` entries with no containment check, and
 *   it recurses. `files: ["../../etc"]` would have enumerated the filesystem
 *   above the project. It throws.
 *
 * Measured over 53 tests, predicted first:
 *
 * | Mutation | Predicted | Red |
 * |---|---|---|
 * | unresolved joins not reported | 2 | **1** |
 * | alias refusal removed | 1 | 1 |
 * | traversal guard removed | 1 | 1 |
 *
 * The first missed because the escaped-character case asks
 * `unresolvedModuleRelativeJoins` directly rather than going through
 * `packageClosureViolations` — the scanner's classification and the reporting
 * of it are two questions, and they have a case each. The six rows above were
 * re-measured against this tree and reproduce exactly: 1, 1, 1, 8, 3, 8.
 *
 * ## Two more, from the review of the commit that fixed those four
 * ## (CLOSURE-11, 12, 13)
 *
 * Both are ways the ALLOWLIST means something other than what this module
 * modelled, which makes everything downstream vacuous rather than wrong.
 *
 * - **Globs are legal `files[]` syntax and resolved to nothing.** Measured:
 *   `files: ["scripts/*.ts"]` produced a published set of exactly
 *   `{package.json}`, so the closure loop walked no source and returned `[]`.
 *   A package using ordinary npm syntax got a clean bill of health from a
 *   check that had not read a line of it. Refused rather than expanded —
 *   implementing glob semantics is a bigger surface than this needs, and a
 *   silent mis-model is worse than a loud limitation.
 * - **A symlink escapes `relative()`**, because the path STRING stays under
 *   the root and only the inode leaves. `files: ["linked/"]` enumerated
 *   `secret.txt` from a directory outside the package. `lstat` now refuses at
 *   BOTH levels, and they are separate guards with separate cases: the first
 *   draft checked only inside the recursion, so a symlink named as the entry
 *   itself walked straight past it.
 *
 * `packageClosureViolations` also refuses a scan that read zero source files.
 * Every route to an empty set found so far throws somewhere above — but a
 * glob was not on that list an hour ago, and the list is not knowable in
 * advance. ADR-002 D4 makes the same argument for CONFIG-1.
 *
 * Predicted first, then measured over 45 tests — all four as predicted:
 *
 * | Mutation | Predicted | Red |
 * |---|---|---|
 * | glob refusal removed | 5 | 5 |
 * | symlink refusal removed at the entry level | 1 | 1 |
 * | symlink refusal removed inside the recursion | 1 | 1 |
 * | empty-scan refusal removed | 1 | 1 |
 *
 * The two symlink rows are 1 and 1 rather than 2 and 0, which is the whole
 * reason both guards stay: each has an input the other cannot reach.

/**
 * #1174. Covers CLOSURE-14, CLOSURE-15.
 *
 * The two scanners above ask what published CODE reaches. An instruction
 * string reaches nothing — it is read by a person, who then runs it — so both
 * were structurally incapable of seeing the defect this describes, and both
 * reported the package closed while it shipped an unrunnable repair command.
 *
 * The negative control is the live tree at the parent commit: with `gates/`
 * absent from `files[]`, `instructionPaths` finds six violations — four in
 * `hooks/`, two in `lib/`. Adding `gates/` takes it to zero. That is a check
 * observed failing against the real defect rather than only against a
 * fixture, which is what `.claude/rules/checks-must-be-able-to-fail.md` asks
 * for before the check is believed.
