/**
 * Two exported functions may not share a name and disagree about what it
 * means (#1398).
 *
 * `findingKey` was declared twice — `lib/ai-review-rounds.ts` keyed a finding
 * on file + line anchor + summary and could return `null`; `lib/scaffold/
 * ai-review-findings.ts` keyed it on file + summary and never could. A call
 * site reading `findingKey(f)` could not tell you which question it had just
 * asked, and the two answer different ones: one is an ADJUDICATION key
 * ("has this advisory already been counted on this run"), the other a
 * PERSISTENCE key ("is the thing this round raised the thing the last round
 * raised").
 *
 * ## What this file does NOT claim
 *
 * It does not claim the two rules can drift into each other. They cannot,
 * and that was measured rather than assumed before this guard was written:
 * collapsing the cross-round key onto a line number reddens 6 cases in
 * `test/ai-review-ledger-read.test.ts`, and adding the line to the payload
 * key reddens `AD-7` in `test/ai-review-advisory-findings.test.ts`. Both
 * mutants were predicted to survive and both were caught.
 *
 * So the risk this file covers is the one nothing else did: the NAME. A
 * third `findingKey` can be added tomorrow, in a third file, keyed a third
 * way, and no case anywhere would notice.
 *
 * ## Two guards, because one name and one identity are different questions
 *
 * `KEY-1` no exported `*Key`/`*Keys` function name is declared in more than
 * one file. This is what makes a call site's `advisoryKey(...)` legible
 * without knowing which module it came from.
 *
 * `KEY-2` every exported `*Key`/`*Keys` in the two finding-identity modules
 * states its identity, in its OWN docblock, and names the other.
 *
 * Together they cover AC-3: a third `findingKey` lands either under the same
 * name somewhere (KEY-1) or inside one of the two identity modules (KEY-2).
 * A new key under a NEW name in a THIRD module is deliberately not an error
 * — there is no ambiguity at a call site to protect against, and a guard
 * wider than its subject is how `.claude/rules/checks-must-be-able-to-fail.md`
 * says these go wrong.
 *
 * ## The extractor is run over planted sources as well as the real tree
 *
 * Every assertion about the repository is paired with one over a fixture
 * string, because a regex that matches nothing reads exactly like a tree
 * with no duplicates and no missing tags. The fixtures are the only thing
 * that can tell those apart.

/**
 * KEY-4 (#1464): what the extractor COSTS, which is a property of this scan
 * and not of any key.
 *
 * The three rows in KEY-1 that walk the repository timed out at 5000ms on
 * PR #1361's shard 3 (run `40033596947`), at ~7.7s each, while the same rows
 * on `main` took ~550ms and every planted-fixture row in this file took
 * 0.2ms. #1361's diff is 420 lines in two files and does not declare a key.
 * It was not the cause: it put a spawn-heavy battery in the same shard, and a
 * CPU-bound row with a 520ms floor went over a 5000ms budget under that
 * contention. The contention was the trigger; the floor was the defect.
 *
 * The floor came from taking each key's own docblock with a greedy
 * `[\s\S]*` over the whole file prefix, anchored at `$`. One file —
 * `lib/ticked-sc-symbols.ts` — paid 521.8ms for a single key, three times per
 * run, because each of the three rows re-walks the tree.
 *
 * ## The expensive case is the one that finds NOTHING
 *
 * This is worth stating because the obvious fixture does not reproduce it,
 * and the first draft of this block used the obvious fixture and passed.
 *
 * `absentSymbolKey` in that file has no docblock of its own: the prefix ends
 * `}\n\n`, closing an interface. So `\*\/\s*$` can never be satisfied, and
 * the engine has to prove that — trying every backtrack position of the
 * greedy prefix, against every `/**` it meets, expanding the lazy inner to
 * every following `*/`. A key that HAS a docblock matches on the first few
 * backtracks and costs nothing. The driver is the number of `/**`…`*\/` pairs
 * sitting before an UNDOCUMENTED declaration, and the growth on it is steeper
 * than quadratic — measured 2026-10-23, doubling the pairs costs ~8x:
 *
 * ```
 * pairs   bytes   greedy(ms)   lastIndexOf(ms)
 *    50    3399         78.6              0.01
 *   100    6749        615.4              0.01
 *   200   13649       5006.7              0.02
 * ```
 *
 * At 200 pairs a single undocumented key exceeds this file's whole 5000ms
 * budget on its own.
 *
 * The requirement the greedy prefix implemented is right and is unchanged: it
 * resolves to the LAST `/**`, so a module header cannot satisfy the check for
 * a function that states nothing. *"The CONTROL — a FILE-level tag does not
 * satisfy the FUNCTION's docblock"* above is that requirement, and it is the
 * row that must keep passing. Backtracking was only an expensive way to say
 * "the last one"; `lastIndexOf` says it directly.
 *
 * ## Why this row is a clock, and why that is defensible here
 *
 * A duration is normally the worst thing to assert on — see
 * `.claude/rules/checks-must-be-able-to-fail.md`. It is sound here only
 * because the gap is not marginal. On the fixture below, measured both ways
 * before this was written: **1066.5ms against 0.02ms**, a factor of ~53,000.
 * The budget sits 4x under the greedy cost and four orders of magnitude over
 * the `lastIndexOf` one, so no plausible machine speed reorders them.
