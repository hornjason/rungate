/**
 * #1286 — `audit-specs --fix` must not write a spec a generator produces.
 *
 * On 2026-10-22 `--fix` injected 39 `<!-- REVIEW: unmatched (...) -->` lines
 * into a consumer's `specs/POV-SPEC.md`, which is produced by that
 * consumer's `scripts/sync-spec.ts` and hash-pinned by its
 * `test/spec-drift.test.ts`. The edit broke the recorded hash and would have
 * been discarded by the next regeneration: destructive and futile at once.
 * The file declared itself derived, in English, above the fold.
 *
 * ## What this battery mutates, and why there is exactly one thing to mutate
 *
 * `mayWrite` in `lib/derived-spec.ts` is the only place the three readings
 * become a yes or a no, and the case below asserts that — the comparison is
 * required to appear exactly once in the source, so a mutant cannot be held
 * up by a surviving second decider (the fourth shape in
 * `.claude/rules/checks-must-be-able-to-fail.md`).
 *
 * The mutant is a copy of `lib/derived-spec.ts` with that comparison replaced
 * by `return true` — "every file is authored", which is both the pre-#1286
 * behaviour and the shape of the regression somebody would plausibly
 * reintroduce. A copy of `scripts/audit-specs.ts` sits beside it with its
 * other relative imports rewritten to absolute paths, so `../lib/derived-spec`
 * is the ONE specifier that resolves into the mutant tree. `config/` is
 * copied too, because `loadRegistry()` resolves the matcher registry through
 * `import.meta.url` and a mutant that died looking for it would read as a
 * guard that held.
 *
 * Three properties keep the count honest, each its own assertion:
 *
 *   - **The baseline is read first.** The real run is asserted before any
 *     mutant run, because an instrument that stopped reporting takes the
 *     baseline down with it and that is the row nobody checks.
 *   - **A positive control the mutation cannot reach.** The hand-authored
 *     fixture is rewritten by the real run AND by the mutant. A mutant that
 *     failed to load, or one that refused everything, fails that row — so a
 *     "the derived file got written" result cannot come from a broken mutant.
 *   - **Green and red are compared by name**, never as "2 of 3".
 *
 * ## What #1552 deleted from this file, and why
 *
 * The per-FILE classification sweep that used to close this file — every
 * read-then-write candidate had to appear on `IN_PLACE_SPEC_WRITERS`,
 * `GUARDED_UPSTREAM` or `NOT_SPEC_WRITERS` — is gone. It answered "has
 * somebody classified this file", and `test/spec-write-chokepoint.test.ts`
 * now answers the strictly stronger "does a raw write primitive aim at a spec
 * path", per CALL SITE rather than per file. Two mechanisms answering one
 * question are the fourth shape one level up: no behavioural test can tell
 * them apart, and the weaker one goes on reading as covered.
 *
 * Exactly one property did not transfer — `GUARDED_UPSTREAM`, which asserts
 * that `hooks/DocHygiene.hook.ts` can only write through `lib/frontmatter.ts`.
 * The sweep cannot see that target, so silence about it would be blindness
 * rather than safety. It moved to the new file as a declared list of its own.
 *
 * What stays here: the mutation battery over `audit-specs --fix`, and the
 * corpus control on the prose detector. Both test `mayWrite` and
 * `readDerivedDeclaration` — a different question from "did the write go
 * through the chokepoint".
