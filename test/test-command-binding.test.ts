/**
 * Covers SC-1904..SC-1907 (HARNESS-STANDARD.md), #488.
 *
 * `createCiWorkflows` emitted `- run: bun test` while `harness` was in
 * scope and three of its siblings read `harness?.ci?.*` four lines above.
 * Every other consumer of `dev.testCmd` honoured it, so a consumer who set
 * the field got agent briefs, an AGENTS.md row and a ship workflow using
 * their command, and a CI workflow using a different one.
 *
 * The issue's SC-2 is the one that shapes this file: the CI step and the
 * AGENTS.md row must resolve through ONE binding, because two sites that
 * agree today are one decider too many and no behavioural test can tell
 * them apart. So every case below drives `testCommandDecision` or the real
 * generators, and SC-1906 asserts that short-circuiting the binding moves
 * BOTH outputs — the property a pair of agreeing literals cannot have.

 * The test command the generated CI job names, by generating it.
 *
 * Through `testCommandsNamedByCiWorkflow`, which is the production answer to
 * "which run line is the test step, and what command does it name". This was
 * a hand-rolled copy of that walk — the same question answered twice, so a
 * mutation of either left the other holding every case up.
 *
 * Delegating also makes the CI-only instrumentation invisible here, which is
 * the point rather than a side effect: #1173 appends
 * `--reporter=junit --reporter-outfile=…` to a `bun test` command, and the
 * copy compared it raw and reported that CI had overridden the operator's
 * command. The strip is the production one, so if it ever stops stripping,
 * `test/test-command-agreement.test.ts` is what goes red, not this.
