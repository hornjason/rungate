/**
 * Covers SC-808, SC-809, SC-810, SC-811 (AGENTS-MD-TEMPLATE-SPEC.md).
 *
 * #363 — `AGENTS.md` published `bunx rungate create-spec` to every scaffolded
 * project while `package.json` declared no `bin`. Three things have to agree
 * and only one of them is code:
 *
 *   1. `bin/rungate.ts` can run the command
 *   2. `package.json`'s `files` ships the script it runs
 *   3. the AGENTS.md generator publishes the command to a consumer
 *
 * All three were wrong at once, each hiding behind the next: no `bin`, so
 * nobody got far enough to notice that `scripts/create-spec.ts` was not in
 * `files` either.
 *
 * The issue warned about the vacuous version of this test by name — asserting
 * the table *contains* the text passes over the exact defect. So every
 * command is RUN, and the `files` membership is checked against the real
 * manifest rather than against a list restated here.

/**
 * A dispatched script is an ENTRY MODULE.
 *
 * `bin/rungate.ts` used to rewrite `process.argv` and `await import(script)`.
 * `import.meta.main` is false for a dynamic import, so the three command
 * scripts that guard their CLI body on it loaded, ran nothing and exited 0.
 * Measured on `3da782dc`, dispatcher vs the same script run directly:
 * `audit-specs` 0B vs 2092B, `sync-spec-tests` 0B vs 1254B,
 * `extract-constraints` 0B vs 57B. Three of ten commands reported success
 * having done nothing.
 *
 * ## Why this does not enumerate the ten commands
 *
 * Because enumerating is what failed. "a registered command dispatches — the
 * script RUNS, not merely resolves" above is correct, says so in its own
 * comment, and runs `create-sc --list` — one member of a population of ten,
 * and one of the six that never had the guard. It varied the dispatcher and
 * held the COMMAND fixed while the defect sat on the command axis
 * (`.claude/rules/checks-must-be-able-to-fail.md`, seventh shape).
 *
 * Adding nine more rows would be the same mistake with a longer list: two of
 * the ten WRITE when run bare, so the enumeration would either dirty the tree
 * or carry exclusions, and an excluded row is an unmeasured one.
 *
 * So the axis is removed rather than covered. `runCommandScript` is the one
 * binding that decides how any subcommand is invoked; once it runs the script
 * as an entry module, every command is reached by construction and there is
 * no per-command question left to ask. These cases pin that one fact, and the
 * last one pins that `bin/rungate.ts` actually routes through it — because
 * the mechanism being right proves nothing if the dispatcher stops calling it.
