/**
 * ai-review-ignored-reading.test.ts — the drift reading stops taking its
 * answer off ignore files the reviewer can write (#969), without reading the
 * review tool's own scratch as a reviewer edit (#1002, #1008).
 *
 * ## What #965 left open
 *
 * PR #965 put `AI_REVIEW_GIT_ISOLATED` in front of the two git calls in
 * `AI_REVIEW_TREE_READER`, closing the GLOBAL config door. Three doors are
 * inside the checkout the reviewer sits in, and #965 names them in its own
 * `## Scope` paragraph as out of scope:
 *
 * - `.git/info/exclude` — fixed path, never reported by `git status` at any
 *   setting, and `core.excludesFile=/dev/null` does not touch it;
 * - `.gitignore` at any depth, including one that hides itself;
 * - `.git/config`, whose `core.*` keys the `-c` flags DO outrank — measured by
 *   `test/ai-review-git-config-isolation.test.ts` AC-2/3/4, and the control
 *   here is AC-5.
 *
 * **"Neutralise them" and "review them" are the same action** for the middle
 * one, which is why this file does not neutralise anything. A reader that
 * ignores `.gitignore` reports every build artefact as an untracked plant and
 * refuses every pull request, which is #871's cheapest wrong fix. The fix is
 * `--ignored=matching`: the ignore files keep working and the reader stops
 * depending on them, because an ignored path is still enumerated and still
 * cancels against the baseline.
 *
 * ## THE SECOND HALF, which the first attempt did not have
 *
 * #1002 shipped the flag with 824 lines of tests, every one green, and broke
 * **every pull request in this repository**. None of those tests ran the
 * reviewer. `anthropics/claude-code-action` copies the pull request's
 * sensitive config into `.claude-pr/` mid-review and calls
 * `ensureClaudePrExcludedFromGit()`, which appends its own pattern to
 * `.git/info/exclude` — so the directory is ignored by a mid-review write to
 * the very file this flag exists to stop trusting, `matching` collapses it to
 * one entry, and the comparison read the review tool's own scratch as the
 * reviewer deleting something: `absent .claude-pr/`.
 *
 * Measured by me on attempt 1 of every run in the window, because the
 * run-level conclusion hides it — four of the five were re-run after the
 * revert and `gh run list` reports the latest attempt:
 *
 * ```
 * 22:01:23  refuse=success     22:20:44  refuse=FAILURE
 * 22:03:34  refuse=success     22:23:16  refuse=FAILURE
 * ---- #1002 merges 22:04:58 ----  22:26:02  refuse=FAILURE
 *                                22:29:17  refuse=FAILURE
 *                                22:30:38  refuse=FAILURE
 * ---- #1008 reverts 22:40:05 ----
 * ```
 *
 * So **AC-7 is the acceptance**, not AC-1 to AC-6: the review tool's own
 * scratch appears between the two readings, exactly as the action makes it
 * appear, and the drift step stays GREEN. AC-8 is the other half — the
 * exemption that buys AC-7 is exactly one entry and buys nothing else.
 *
 * ## Why an exemption at all, and why not the shape that was suggested
 *
 * The suggestion was to distinguish a collapsed DIRECTORY entry from a file's
 * bytes changing — a directory appearing and vanishing is not the same event.
 * That is true and it does not separate this directory from a plant: a
 * reviewer that writes `evil/` and an ignore pattern for it produces exactly
 * the same shape. Taking the route would have been legibility dressed as a
 * mechanism, and AC-8/directory is the case that says so — an ignored
 * directory the reviewer creates is still drift.
 *
 * There is no structural property that separates the action's scratch from a
 * plant, because the action creates it inside the checkout, mid-review, and
 * ignores it. The choice is between naming one path and not closing the
 * ignore-file door at all. What keeps the name from being a subtraction list
 * is that it is an EXACT match on a path that can only ever be a directory:
 * `.claude-pr-evil/`, `src/.claude-pr/` and `.claude-pr/plant.md` are all
 * still reported, and AC-8 refuses each of them.
 *
 * ## Everything below is executed
 *
 * #952 shipped 17 green cases over a fix that did not work, because every one
 * asserted that the repaired string appeared in the emitted YAML. So every
 * behavioural case here plants a real file in a real repository, poisons a
 * real in-repo ignore file, and runs the real emitted bash twice — hardened,
 * and with the mechanism stripped back out MECHANICALLY from
 * `AI_REVIEW_IGNORED_READING`, the single constant that carries it. A
 * hand-written copy of the old command would stay green while the shipped
 * constant was gutted.
 *
 * ## The measured battery, and WHICH assertion each row reddens
 *
 * Run over this file alone. `lib/scaffold/ai-review-step.ts` was restored from
 * a `cp` backup after every row — never `git checkout --` — and confirmed
 * byte-identical by sha256 afterwards. **The baseline row was read before any
 * mutation row.** Every count was predicted before the battery ran, and the
 * `Predicted` column is that prediction, kept rather than quietly corrected.
 *
 * | Row | Mutation | Predicted | Measured | Which assertions |
 * |---|---|---|---|---|
 * | **baseline** | unmutated | 20 pass, 0 fail | **20 pass, 0 fail** | — |
 * | **M1** | `AI_REVIEW_IGNORED_READING` = `--ignored=no` — the pre-#969 reader | 12 | **12 of 20** | AC-1 ×2, AC-2, AC-3, AC-4/hardened, AC-6 ×3, AC-7/control, AC-8/sibling, AC-8/nested, AC-8/directory |
 * | **M4** | `--ignored=traditional` instead of `matching` | 5 | **6 of 20** | AC-3, AC-6/volume, AC-6/limit, AC-7/green, AC-8/inside, **+ AC-7/control** |
 * | **M7** | the scratch exemption removed | 3 | **3 of 20** | AC-7/green, AC-7/control, AC-8/exactly-one |
 * | **M8** | the exemption widened to a PREFIX (trailing slash dropped) | 1 | **3 of 20** | AC-8/sibling, **+ AC-7/control, AC-8/exactly-one** |
 * | **M9** | the exemption widened to a SUBSTRING match | 1 | **1 of 20** | AC-8/nested |
 *
 * M1's value is `--ignored=no` rather than the empty string on purpose: an
 * empty constant makes `unignore` split on a bare space and join the whole
 * command back together without any, so the mutant would be a syntax error
 * rather than the pre-#969 reader.
 *
 * **Before believing any row, the input on which mutant and original differ,
 * named and run rather than assumed.** M1: a `.git/info/exclude` holding one
 * line — the original reports `<sha1> planted-by-the-reviewer.md`, the mutant
 * reports nothing. M4: a tree with 60 files under an ignored `node_modules/` —
 * the original reads 1 line for it, the mutant 60. M7: the action's own
 * scratch created between the two readings — the original's drift step exits
 * 0, the mutant's exits 1 with `absent .claude-pr/`, which IS the outage.
 * M8: `.claude-pr-evil/`, which the original reports and the mutant does not.
 * M9: `src/.claude-pr/`, same.
 *
 * ### The rows that came back high, and why every extra is the real kind
 *
 * **M4's extra is AC-7/control.** `traditional` enumerates the scratch file by
 * file, and the exemption is an exact match on the directory entry, so
 * `.claude-pr/CLAUDE.md` is reported WITH the exemption in place — the half
 * of that case asserting the exemption exempts correctly reds.
 *
 * **M8's two extras are the vacuity guards working.** Widening the match also
 * changes the spelling, so the reader no longer contains the constant:
 * AC-8/exactly-one counts zero occurrences, and AC-7/control can no longer
 * strip what it is supposed to strip, which is exactly what that assertion is
 * for. Neither is a case reddening for an unrelated reason.
 *
 * **No row collapses the file**, and the one row that could — M1, the whole
 * flag — leaves eight cases green, including both halves of AC-4's pair and
 * the `.git/config` control.
 *
 * **AC-7/cleanup reds under no row, and that is recorded rather than hidden.**
 * A directory git no longer sees produces no line at all, so every mutant
 * passes it. It is a control over the stated acceptance — "appears and
 * disappears" — not a witness of anything, and its witnesses are AC-7/green
 * and AC-7/control. The whole battery was re-taken after it was added; every
 * count is unchanged and the denominator is 20.
 *
 * ## UNMEASURED, said out loud
 *
 * 1. **A write inside a directory that was already collapsed-ignored at
 *    baseline** — `node_modules/evil.js` — is still invisible. `matching`
 *    reports the directory as one entry in both readings and the entry does
 *    not change. AC-6/limit ASSERTS the blindness, so it is recorded rather
 *    than implied, and whoever makes it visible deletes the note rather than
 *    leaving it to outlive its subject.
 * 2. **A write inside `.claude-pr/` under a name the action snapshots** —
 *    `.claude-pr/.claude/EVIL.md` — is invisible for the same reason plus the
 *    exemption. AC-8/limit asserts it. The TOP of that directory is read as
 *    of #1071 and AC-12 is that half; what is left is one level down.
 * 3. **`.git/config` as a door is covered by #965's `-c` flags, not by
 *    anything here.** AC-5 is the control that says so by measurement rather
 *    than by citation.

// ── AC-12: the exempted subtree is read one level down (#1071) ────────────

/**
 * The exemption above dropped the ONLY line. `--ignored=matching` collapses
 * the whole ignored subtree to `!! .claude-pr/`, and that entry is the one
 * exempted, so the reading was EMPTY and the drift step had nothing to
 * compare — `.claude-pr/EVIL.md` was invisible at any depth.
 *
 * The exemption is unavoidable and stays. What changed is that the reader
 * DESCENDS one level instead of returning, drops the names the action
 * snapshots, and classifies the rest through the same `classify_path` the
 * rest of the reading goes through.
 *
 * ## The mutant, and why it is this one
 *
 * `AI_REVIEW_SCRATCH_SCAN_LIMIT` is driven to 0, mechanically, from the
 * exported constant. The counter starts at 1, so the walk breaks on its first
 * entry and the reader is the pre-#1071 reader exactly — an empty reading for
 * the scratch — without a hand-written copy of the old bash that would stay
 * green while the shipped one was gutted.
 *
 * ## The measured battery, and WHICH assertion each row reddens
 *
 * Run over this file alone, 37 cases, on the tree that carries #1070.
 * `lib/scaffold/ai-review-step.ts` was restored from a `cp` backup after every
 * row — never `git checkout --` — and confirmed byte-identical by sha256
 * afterwards. **The baseline row was read before any mutation row.**
 *
 * | Row | Mutation | Measured | Which assertions |
 * |---|---|---|---|
 * | **baseline** | unmutated | **37 pass, 0 fail** | — |
 * | **M10** | the descent stripped: `AI_REVIEW_SCRATCH_SCAN_LIMIT` driven to 0 | **5 of 37** | AC-12 ×5 — empty, end-to-end, directory, symlink, bound |
 * | **M11** | the `-L` half of the glob guard dropped | **1 of 37** | AC-12/symlink |
 * | **M12** | the mirror filter removed — every scratch entry reported | **7 of 37** | AC-7/green, AC-7/control, AC-8/limit, AC-10/control, AC-12/CONTROL, AC-12/volume, AC-12/widening |
 * | **M13** | **the cheapest wrong fix** — the conditional exemption #1071 proposes | **5 of 37** | the same five as M10 |
 *
 * **The input on which mutant and original differ, named and run rather than
 * assumed.** M10: `.claude-pr/EVIL.md` written after the action's scratch —
 * the original reports `<sha1> .claude-pr/EVIL.md`, the mutant reports
 * nothing. M11: a dangling `.claude-pr/evil-link` — `[ -e ]` follows the link
 * and is false, so the mutant drops the entry before anything classifies it.
 * M12: `.claude-pr/.claude/settings.json`, which the action itself writes —
 * the mutant reports it and the drift step refuses, which IS PR #1002's
 * outage.
 *
 * **There is no row for the directory shape, and that is the composition with
 * #1070 rather than an omission.** An earlier draft of the walk tested
 * `[ -d ]` so it could hand a directory on in git's collapsed shape, and that
 * draft HAD such a row. #1070 landed first and taught `classify_path` to ask
 * the property, so the shape test was deleted rather than rebased: there is
 * nothing left in the walk to mutate, and `AC-12/ONE decider` is what says so
 * — it reds under M10 because the entry vanishes, and it would red again the
 * day someone re-introduces a second decider that answers `absent`.
 *
 * **M13 is the cheapest wrong fix and it is run, not argued.** #1071 measured
 * the conditional exemption as a no-op — the collapsed form only exists once
 * the action has written `/.claude-pr/` to `.git/info/exclude`, which is
 * after the baseline, so the baseline can never carry it and the guard's
 * condition is always true. Implemented faithfully (`grep -F -x -q` against
 * the baseline file, the descent removed) it reds exactly the five rows M10
 * reds, which is the measurement agreeing with the issue. The five are REAL,
 * not vacuous: each one asserts an observable difference in the reading, and
 * the mutant produces the pre-#1071 reading.
 *
 * **M12 is the row that matters most**, because it is the only mutation that
 * can take the fleet down: it reds both #1002 controls plus this suite's new
 * one. The thing keeping every pull request green is witnessed, not assumed.

// ── AC-13: a scratch entry's NAME cannot forge a record (#1071 follow-up) ──

/**
 * `read_scratch` (#1071) is the first path source in this reader that does not
 * come from git, and #1071 shipped without noticing what that costs.
 *
 * `classify_path`'s quoting guard was anchored at position 0 — `'"'*` — and it
 * is right for git: porcelain v1 C-quotes any path carrying a newline, a quote
 * or a backslash, so a git-derived path arrives already wrapped. The walk globs
 * the FILESYSTEM. Nothing wraps those names, nothing rejected them, and the
 * last line of `classify_path` prints the path. So an entry named with an
 * embedded newline printed as TWO lines, and the second was indistinguishable
 * from a record the reader produced — written by the exact actor the reader
 * exists to measure, because #1071's whole premise is that a reviewer can
 * write under that path.
 *
 * ## Measured on `origin/main` at `77dd0f7f`, the merge commit of #1081
 *
 * The reviewer creates one file, named `p<newline>absent .ripgreprc`:
 *
 * ```
 * reading : de12637f… .claude-pr/p
 *           absent .ripgreprc        <-- FORGED, and not a path on disk
 * ```
 *
 * End to end through the real baseline and drift steps, with a base that does
 * not carry `.ripgreprc`: the forged line reaches #989's twice-restored
 * classifier, is acquitted, and is named in the UNMEASURED warning as
 * *"restored a SECOND time by the review action"*. A reader of that annotation
 * has been told the reviewer's own filename was the action's work.
 *
 * ## What it is NOT, stated so the fix is not oversold
 *
 * It is **not** a detection bypass. `added = after − before` only ADDS, so the
 * entry's own genuine first line — `<sha> .claude-pr/p`, not under an untrusted
 * path — stays in `added` and the step still exits 1. What the injection buys
 * is a false attribution and attacker-chosen text in an annotation, which is
 * the harm #1061 and #1070 each argued is worse than silence. AC-13/refuses is
 * the case that pins the exit code so this stays honest in both directions.
 *
 * ## The fix is ONE decision, and the slash is why the witness looks like this
 *
 * A filename cannot contain `/`, so a forged record can only name a
 * single-component path. That is not a mitigation: `.ripgreprc`, `.claude` and
 * `CLAUDE.md` are all single components and all in `AI_REVIEW_UNTRUSTED_PATHS`,
 * which is exactly the set #989's classifier acts on. The first draft of this
 * case used `absent .claude/evil/` and could not be written to disk at all —
 * kept here because a fixture that cannot be created is a case that would have
 * gone green by erroring in setup.
 *
 * The guard lives in `classify_path`, not in the walk: "is this path safe to
 * print" has one answer, and a second guard beside it is one decider with a
 * spare. The redaction is unconditional on the `printf` for the same reason —
 * a branch there would be that second decider, and for every git-derived path
 * the expression is the identity.
 *
 * ## The measured battery, and which half does which job
 *
 * Run over this file alone. The source was restored from a `cp` backup after
 * every row and confirmed byte-identical by sha256. **The baseline row was
 * read before any mutation row.**
 *
 * | Row | Mutation | Measured | Which assertions |
 * |---|---|---|---|
 * | **baseline** | unmutated | **42 pass, 0 fail** | — |
 * | **N1** | **the cheapest wrong fix** — `*'"'*` (a quote anywhere) instead of the newline | **1 of 42** | AC-13/REDACTED |
 * | **N2** | the `printf` redaction removed, the `case` arm kept | **2 of 42** | AC-13/one-line, AC-13/end-to-end |
 * | **N3** | both removed — the state shipped in #1081 | **3 of 42** | all three behavioural AC-13 cases |
 *
 * **The input on which mutant and original differ**: a scratch entry named
 * `p<newline>absent .ripgreprc`. N3 prints two lines and the second is the
 * forged record; the original prints `unquotable .claude-pr/p`.
 *
 * **N1 corrected a claim the first draft of this fix made.** The `case` arm
 * was described as what closes the forgery. It is not — with a wrong arm and
 * the truncation in place the reading is already one line, and only the TOKEN
 * is wrong. So the two halves do different jobs: the truncation closes the
 * forgery, the arm stops the reader asserting a content hash about a name it
 * did not print and routes the entry into the UNMEASURED annotation. N2 and N3
 * take them apart, and the source comment was rewritten to say so.
 *
 * **Would a quote-only case have survived the cheapest wrong fix? No — it
 * would have been VACUOUS.** A name carrying a `"` and no newline matches
 * `*'"'*`, so N1 goes green on it and the case witnesses nothing. That is
 * exactly why every behavioural case here is built around the newline: the
 * newline is what forges a record, and it is the input the cheapest wrong fix
 * does not cover.

// ── AC-14: the redacted record names the entry it is about (#1104) ────────

/**
 * #1099 made the record single-line by TRUNCATING the path at its first
 * newline. That closed the forgery and left a reading a human cannot act on.
 *
 * ## Measured on `origin/main` at `6bb6038a`, #1099's own merge commit
 *
 * The reviewer creates a genuine `x` and an `x<newline>y` beside it:
 *
 * ```
 * 6fc771e41b50ca95d537b571b73bfe5b368fe291 .claude-pr/x
 * unquotable .claude-pr/x
 * ```
 *
 * Two records, one path name. Fail-safe — both stay in `added` and both
 * refuse — and only one of the two lines is about a file at that path.
 *
 * ## Why escaping and not full redaction
 *
 * Dropping the path (`unquotable` alone, or a fixed placeholder) removes the
 * collision and costs more than it saves: two distinct plants would collapse
 * to byte-identical lines, `grep -F -x -v` would fold them into one, and the
 * refusal would name neither. `%q` is injective and single-line, so the name
 * survives in full and two entries can never collide.
 *
 * ## The coupling this must not break, and it is not the obvious one
 *
 * `%q` is the IDENTITY for a path with no shell-special characters, which is
 * why an unconditional version looks green. The drift step does
 * `p="${line#* }"` and hands the result to `git cat-file -e <base>:<path>`
 * (#989), so an escaped ordinary path stops resolving on the base and stops
 * being acquitted. The characters that expose it are the ones git does NOT
 * quote but `%q` DOES — `$`, `*`, `?`, `&`, `;`, `'` — not the space, which
 * git quotes itself. AC-14/#989 is built on `$` for that reason.
 *
 * ## The measured battery
 *
 * Run over this file alone. The source was restored from a `cp` backup after
 * every row and confirmed byte-identical by sha256. **The baseline row was
 * read before any mutation row**, and every count was predicted before the
 * battery ran — the `Predicted` column is that prediction, kept rather than
 * quietly corrected.
 *
 * | Row | Mutation | Predicted | Measured | Which assertions |
 * |---|---|---|---|---|
 * | **baseline** | unmutated | 46 pass, 0 fail | **46 pass, 0 fail** | — |
 * | **U1** | `%q` applied UNCONDITIONALLY | 2 | **3 of 46** | AC-13/control, **AC-14/#989**, + AC-14/renderer |
 * | **U2** | the escape removed — the pre-#1099 forging state | 5 | **5 of 46** | AC-13/one-line, AC-13/REDACTED, AC-14/collision, AC-14/whole-name, + AC-14/renderer |
 * | **U3** | truncation instead of escape — the #1099 shipped state | 3 | **4 of 46** | AC-13/REDACTED, AC-14/collision, AC-14/whole-name, + AC-14/renderer |
 * | **U4** | the two `case` arms merged back into one | 2 | **3 of 46** | AC-13/ONE-decider, AC-13/control, + AC-14/renderer |
 *
 * **U1 is the row that matters**, and it answers a question asked before it
 * ran: *does anything here actually exercise #989's path resolution, or would
 * an unconditional escape red zero cases?* It reds `AC-14/#989`. The coupling
 * is exercised and protected, not assumed.
 *
 * ### The rows that came back high, and the one member predicted wrong
 *
 * **AC-14/renderer is the extra in all four rows**, because it slices the
 * renderer out of the reader and asserts its shape — any mutation of the
 * renderer moves it. That makes it a vacuity guard rather than a behavioural
 * witness, and it is recorded as one rather than counted as coverage.
 *
 * **U2 matched its count with a different membership, and that is the
 * interesting miss.** `AC-13/end-to-end` was predicted to red and did not. It
 * checks for a LINE equal to the forged record in the drift output; under U2
 * the forged line reaches #989 and is named *inside* the twice-restored
 * warning, so no output line equals it on its own. The case is therefore
 * narrower than its name suggests — it catches a forged record that stands
 * alone, not one quoted inside an annotation. Its witnesses are AC-13/one-line
 * and the AC-14 pair; it is kept as the end-to-end exit-code control it
 * genuinely is, with the limit written down rather than left to be found.

// ── AC-15: a leading quote does not disarm the newline escape (#1869) ─────

/**
 * `case` tries arms in order, and the two `unquotable` arms were in the wrong
 * one. A name that BOTH starts with a literal `"` AND carries a newline matched
 * the git-shape arm first, so `esc` stayed empty, the renderer took the
 * `'%s %s\n'` branch, and the record split into two lines — the forgery AC-13
 * closes, re-entered through the arm order.
 *
 * ## READ THIS FIRST: it is NOT reachable from either caller today, and #1869
 * does not say so
 *
 * The issue's measured table is exactly right about `classify_path` and says
 * nothing about whether any path source can produce its input. Measured here,
 * through the real `read_tree` rather than by reading the code:
 *
 * | source | can carry a RAW newline | can start with `"` |
 * |---|---|---|
 * | `git status --porcelain` | no — git C-quotes it to `\n`, two characters | yes |
 * | `read_scratch` glob | yes — the filesystem wraps nothing | no — every entry is `"${root}"*`, so it begins `.claude-pr/` |
 *
 * The two conditions sit in different sources and no live path has both. The
 * first draft of this battery drove the defect row through `read_tree` and
 * went **green**, because `read_scratch` handed `classify_path`
 * `.claude-pr/"<newline>absent .ripgreprc`, which does not start with a quote
 * and matches the newline arm correctly. That green was the finding: a trace
 * is not a reachability argument, and a case that cannot tell the fix from the
 * defect is worth nothing however true its subject is.
 *
 * So these rows feed `classify_path` DIRECTLY. That is the unit where the
 * defect lives and the only level at which this battery can disagree with
 * itself. Measured on the unfixed source, one `bash` call per row:
 *
 * ```
 * 1 git-quoted, no newline      1 line   unquotable "ordinary name with spaces.md"
 * 2 newline, no leading quote   1 line   unquotable $'evil\nabsent .ripgreprc'
 * 3 newline AND leading quote   2 lines  unquotable "      <- then `absent .ripgreprc`
 * ```
 *
 * ## Why fix an unreachable defect rather than close the issue
 *
 * Because the reachability argument is the one that already failed once. The
 * arm was correct for every caller `classify_path` had until #1071 added
 * `read_scratch`, the first source git had never seen — and the comment over
 * the `case` has warned about precisely that since: *"A path from
 * `read_scratch` was never seen by git and is wrapped by nothing. That is the
 * one that needs escaping below"*. The next source inherits whichever order is
 * there. Reordering two arms costs nothing and moves no token.
 *
 * **It is defence in depth and the pull request says so.** It is not a live
 * forgery, and calling it one would be the overstatement this docblock exists
 * to correct.
 *
 * ## The axis this battery varies
 *
 * Rows 2 and 3 carry the SAME newline payload and differ only in the leading
 * quote, so the quote is the whole cause and nothing else can be
 * (`.claude/rules/checks-must-be-able-to-fail.md`, seventh shape). Row 2 is the
 * control and must stay escaped under every mutation, or the battery is
 * varying the wrong axis. Row 1 is AC-14's control — a git-quoted path with no
 * newline, pinned byte-for-byte through the real reader — and is not restated
 * here, because a second copy of a pinned record is a second place for it to
 * drift.
