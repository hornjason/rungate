// ── #1163: the census is gone, and cannot come back quietly ──────────────

/**
 * The per-directory file census, removed — and held removed.
 *
 * The question these cases ask is not "does the string `fileCount` appear".
 * It is whether the RENDERED table can carry a per-directory number again,
 * because that is the thing that was wrong: MEASURED over the 50 commit
 * transitions ending at `b7281397`, 22 of them moved a count and 0 moved the
 * directory list. A reader cannot tell a count that is right from one that
 * is two merges old, so the file stopped carrying one.
 *
 * **What was broken to prove these fail** (`.claude/rules/checks-must-be-able-to-fail.md`):
 * the renderer's row template was put back to
 * `| ${d.name}/ | ${(d as any).types.length} | ${d.types.join(", ")} |` —
 * the cheapest way to reintroduce a per-directory number now that
 * `fileCount` is off the type. `the table has exactly two columns` went
 * **red**, naming the three-cell row. Restoring the two-column template
 * turned it green again.
 *
 * The ORDER case is the second half, and it is here because the old sort was
 * `b.fileCount - a.fileCount`: an order derived from the census is still the
 * census, one indirection away. Reversing the input must not reverse the
 * output.
