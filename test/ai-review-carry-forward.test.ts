/**
 * #1381 — the walker. `lib/ai-review-rounds.ts` has exported
 * `readLedger → priorFindings → carryForward → noRepeatsInstruction` since
 * #1351 and nothing called any of them: the ledger had a writer and a reader
 * and no walker, and the reviewer's prompt said so out loud until #1351
 * removed the sentence and left the behaviour. A finding re-posted on every
 * round is arithmetically an extra round, and the tail is where this gate's
 * cost is.
 *
 * ## What these cases are written against
 *
 * Not *"carry-forward works"*. A case asserting only that a finding gets
 * carried is green against a walker that carries resolved findings, against
 * one that carries on an unreadable ledger, and against one that cannot tell
 * a re-emission from a new finding. The property is **the three states stay
 * distinguishable**, and the row that makes the rest mean anything is the
 * DROP: a recorded anchor that differs from the line now must produce an
 * empty carry, because without it a walker that carries everything
 * unconditionally passes every other row in the file.
 *
 * ## Why they execute the bash
 *
 * The walker is a `run:` block. Asserting on its SOURCE would pass against a
 * script that cannot run at all, and every property here — "an unreadable
 * ledger is not an empty one", "a finding with no anchor is carried" — is a
 * behaviour. Each case spawns the real generated script under `bash -e`,
 * which is what Actions runs it with, against a planted git index and a
 * `curl` that answers from a FILE (a ledger body carries ```json fences, and
 * a fixture routed through a shell makes those command substitution).

// ── AC-C6: the extractor slices in the units it measures in (#1568) ──────

/**
 * #1568 — the walker called a VALID ledger unparseable on three consecutive
 * rounds of #1569 and started each of them from nothing.
 *
 * ## The cause, which is not the parser
 *
 * jq's `index` on a string returns a **byte** offset and `.[a:b]` slices by
 * **codepoints**. The extractor measured with one and cut with the other, so
 * it overshot by exactly the number of multi-byte UTF-8 bytes before the cut:
 *
 * ```
 * $ jq -nr '"—abcdef" | index("abc")'   # 3  — bytes
 * $ jq -nr '"—abcdef" | .[1:]'          # abcdef — codepoints
 * $ jq -nr '"xabcdef" | index("abc")'   # 1  — the ASCII control agrees
 * ```
 *
 * #1569's ledger is 13,826 codepoints in 13,846 bytes, 16 of that difference
 * inside the fenced block, so `$rest[:$l]` carried the closing fence and the
 * prose after it into the JSON. `readLedger`'s `indexOf`/`slice` pair agrees
 * with itself, which is why two readers disagreed about the same bytes and
 * only the one in CI was wrong.
 *
 * ## The blast radius, measured rather than reasoned about
 *
 * The first reading of this said non-ASCII *before* the opening fence was
 * harmless, because the `index("\n")` that follows re-finds the end of the
 * fence line and absorbs the drift. That is true only while the overshoot
 * stays inside the seven characters of ```` ```json ````. Probed against the
 * pre-#1568 extractor, one body per row:
 *
 * | where the non-ASCII sits | what the old extractor did |
 * |---|---|
 * | nowhere — pure ASCII | read it |
 * | one em dash before the fence | read it |
 * | four em dashes before the fence | **extraction failed outright** |
 * | one em dash inside the JSON | **returned text that does not parse** |
 * | one em dash inside, nothing after the fence | **returned text that does not parse** |
 *
 * So there is no safe amount and no safe position; there is only an amount
 * small enough that one later search happens to cover for it.
 *
 * ## What the battery before this one held fixed
 *
 * `AC-C1` already has a case for an unterminated fence and a case for a block
 * that does not parse, and `AC-C3` already mutates the refusal. Every fixture
 * in all of them is **ASCII**, and the defect is on the other axis — the
 * seventh shape in `.claude/rules/checks-must-be-able-to-fail.md`, where a
 * battery varies the guard while every row hands it the same shape of input.
 * The em dashes were in the findings' own summaries. This repository writes
 * them in every sentence, so the broken path was the ordinary one.
 *
 * ## Why the fixture is a download and not a construction
 *
 * A hand-built non-ASCII body proves the mechanism; it does not prove the
 * mechanism is what bit #1569. `test/fixtures/ai-review-ledger-1569.json` is
 * the comment verbatim off the API, and the row below it is a MUTANT holding
 * the pre-#1568 extractor, so "red before, green after" is performed on every
 * run rather than asserted once in a pull request description.

// ── AC-C7: the ledger snapshot the adjudicator keys from (#1586) ─────────

/**
 * CRC-N4's prior state, captured where it is still the PRIOR state.
 *
 * ## Why the carry step writes it and the adjudicator does not fetch it
 *
 * The generated job runs `ai-review-carry` → the reviewer →
 * `ai-review-persist`, **which upserts this round into the ledger comment**
 * → `ai-review-run`, which adjudicates. An adjudicator that fetched the
 * ledger itself would read a comment already containing the payload it is
 * deciding about: every finding would match a "prior" key that is its own,
 * every round would suppress everything, and the outcome would be CLEAN
 * forever while looking like a dedupe that works. The only position holding
 * the state as it was before the reviewer ran is this step.
 *
 * ## Why the raw body and not the keys
 *
 * `carryKey` is not restated in jq. The bash reaches the body and stops;
 * `readLedger → priorFindings` forms the keys in TypeScript, so there is one
 * decider for a finding's identity. A jq restatement would be #1568's shape
 * again — two readers of the same bytes, differing on a case neither author
 * thought to name.
 *
 * ## The state and the bytes are two files on purpose
 *
 * An absent snapshot cannot say WHY it is absent, and "no earlier findings"
 * versus "the record could not be read" is the distinction #1568 cost three
 * rounds of #1569 to learn. The state stays in the carry file, written on
 * every path by the one `carry_state` site; the snapshot carries only bytes.

 * to this commit, and together they protected a file nothing read: AC-1 moved
 * the suppression gate onto the review THREADS, `SuppressionInputs` kept only
 * `threads`, and `scripts/ai-review-findings.ts` never imported the snapshot

 * ## The gate and this reader deliberately disagree, and that is the point
 *
 * `aiReviewSuppressionGate` asks "has this already been RAISED?", so a
 * resolved thread counts as raised and the finding is not posted twice. This
 * reader asks "is this still UNANSWERED?", so a resolved thread counts as
 * answered and the finding is dropped. Same input, two questions, two

 * one of them and silently break the other — which is why the resolution flag
 * is read here rather than folded away in `priorKeysFrom`.
 *
 * ## Why this is not the anchor rule in different clothes
 *
 * The anchor rule asks the CODE whether a finding is fixed. It cannot see an
 * answer that is not a code change — a false positive closed with a reason,
 * which CRC-C3 exists for. Before this, answering such a thread left the
 * finding carried forever and the reviewer re-raised it every round. That is
 * CRC-N4 measured on #1616: eleven threads for three distinct findings.

 * `normalise` folds `[A-Z]` only, which is exactly what `ascii_downcase` does.

 * all. The rows below are a triple rather than a pair, because a guard can be
