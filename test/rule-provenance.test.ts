/**
 * Covers SC-818, SC-819, SC-820 (SCAFFOLD-DECOMPOSITION-SPEC.md).
 *
 * Also covers SC-202 of bootstrap-data-flow/success-criteria.md — "new rules
 * include provenance comment: source incident and date". `lib/rule-provenance.ts`
 * has implemented that since #370 and this file has driven it since, but the
 * criterion's tick rested on a mention nothing credited (#327). Declared here
 * because this is where the behaviour is actually exercised.
 *
 * #370 — `bun bin/rungate.ts scaffold . --fix` on a clean checkout rewrote
 * eight `.claude/rules/*.md` files unconditionally and reported `GENERATED:`
 * for each. Measured on 2026-10-13, on this repo, with nothing else in the
 * tree:
 *
 *   .claude/rules/checks-must-be-able-to-fail.md | 197 ------------------
 *   .claude/rules/docs-routing.md                |   2 +-
 *   .claude/rules/key-files.md                   |   6 +-
 *
 * The first is the rule three specs cite by path and every mutation table in
 * the repo exists because of. It was truncated from 262 lines to 65 — the
 * generator's canonical opening survives, everything the repo added after it
 * does not. Exit 0, and `git status` says `M`, not `D`.
 *
 * The issue named the vacuous version of this test by name:
 *
 *   > A test that deletes a hand-authored rule file via the real scaffold
 *   > and fails. Asserting the scaffold "preserves files" without running it
 *   > over a file carrying hand-written content is the vacuous version.
 *
 * So the three scaffold cases below SPAWN `scripts/scaffold-project.ts` and
 * read what it left on disk. Each is paired: a hand-edited file must survive,
 * and a harness-written one must still be updated, because a scaffold that
 * preserved everything would satisfy the first case alone and is the other
 * half of the bug (#208).
