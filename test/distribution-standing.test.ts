/**
 * Covers SC-822, SC-823, SC-824 (HARNESS-STANDARD.md).
 *
 * #366 — every mutation count, gate measurement and standing verdict in
 * `SUCCESS.md` was taken against the working tree at `main`, while the
 * artifact a consumer can install is `rungate@0.2.1`. The evidence base and
 * the installable software are different, and nothing in the file said so.
 *
 * The issue named the vacuous version by name:
 *
 *   > Assert that the version recorded in `SUCCESS.md`'s standing section
 *   > matches `npm view rungate version`. Bumping `package.json` without
 *   > publishing must turn it red. An assertion that merely finds *a*
 *   > version string in the file is the vacuous form and passes over this
 *   > defect today.
 *
 * Both halves are here. The registry is REACHED — over the network, from the
 * same endpoint `bun add` resolves against — and the second mutation is the
 * one the issue asked for: a bump with no publish.
 *
 * ## What #1237 changed, and what it deliberately did not
 *
 * The published half of the standing line was compared to the registry's
 * `latest` for equality, and that equality **cannot be true across a
 * release**: the registry moves when `npm publish` lands and the line moves
 * when a human edits it. So every publish reddened `main` until somebody
 * retyped a markdown file, and `SUCCESS.md` is DA-owned (#296) — the agents
 * who hit the failure were the only ones forbidden to clear it. It happened
 * twice on 2026-10-22 (`b7281397`, `803e1e66`), each a one-line hand edit
 * over a red `main`.
 *
 * The line may now lag the registry by **exactly one release** and no
 * further, so a publish no longer reddens `main` and a line two releases
 * stale still does. What did NOT change is the tree half: `standing.tree`
 * must equal `package.json`, because that one IS maintainable atomically —
 * the commit that bumps the version can set both, and CI on that pull
 * request says so before it merges.
 *
 * The state nobody could see before is now its own case:
 * **bumped and never published**. `distributionViolations` refuses it, and
 * `test/publish-window.test.ts` holds the classifier that tells it from a
 * release in flight.
