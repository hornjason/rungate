/**
 * scripts/github-op.ts — the Octokit path workflow steps use for GitHub (#137)
 *
 * SC-529..SC-533 (GITHUB-API-MIGRATION-SPEC Phase 6)
 *
 * These run the script as a real subprocess against a loopback HTTP server, so
 * what is asserted is the request GitHub would have received: method, path,
 * query and body. That is deliberate. The defect this replaces was a step that
 * named a tool which did not exist and reported success anyway, and a test
 * that only checked the script mentions `upsertPR` would have the same shape
 * as the twelve success criteria that stayed green while the client could not
 * authenticate at all (#139).
 *
 * Loopback is reachable because D-8 allowlists it — the test seam and the
 * exfiltration guard are the same rule, which is why this can point a real
 * token-bearing client somewhere harmless.
