/**
 * Covers SC-846, SC-847, SC-848 (AGENTS-MD-TEMPLATE-SPEC.md).
 *
 * #380 — `refreshAgentsMd`'s broken-link check read a backtick span as a
 * file path. AGENTS.md has a Commands table whose commands end in
 * filenames, so the whole command string went to `existsSync`. On this repo
 * it produced three reports, three false positives and zero true positives:
 * the check had never once validated a real reference here.
 *
 * Both directions are asserted throughout, because narrowing a detector to
 * buy green is shape two of `.claude/rules/checks-must-be-able-to-fail.md`
 * and this change is exactly that kind of narrowing.
