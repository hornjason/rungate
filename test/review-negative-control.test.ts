/**
 * review-negative-control.test.ts — #1169.
 *
 * Two halves, and the second is the one that makes the first worth anything.
 *
 * The subjects must prove their own premise. A planted subject that does not
 * actually behave differently from its baseline is not a defect, and a clean
 * subject that does is not clean — in either case the control measures
 * nothing while reporting a number. So the behavioural difference is RUN here,
 * over a table of commands, rather than asserted in a manifest.
 *
 * And the control must be shown able to fail. A reviewer that returns CLEAN
 * unconditionally is exactly the failure #1169 says we cannot currently see,
 * so it is built — as a payload, which is all a reviewer is to this
 * instrument — and the planted subject is required to go red against it. The
 * second mutant blocks on a file nobody planted anything in, and both
 * subjects are required to go red: one for missing the plant, one for firing
 * on a clean diff.
 *
 * The cheapest wrong fix is named and measured rather than dismissed in
 * prose. It is "assert the payload is non-empty" — it is one line, it reads
 * as a detection check, and `the cheapest wrong fix is green over a payload
 * that found nothing` runs it against a payload that names the wrong file
 * entirely and watches it pass.

/**
 * #1507 / CRC-A4 — the convention-break subject proves its own premise.
 *
 * This subject measures something `suite-lock-redirect` cannot: whether the
 * reviewer flags code that is wrong only because this repository says it is.
 * So the premise has two halves rather than one, and both are RUN:
 *
 *   1. the convention is really stated, in the file the reviewer is handed.
 *      A planted "convention break" against a convention nobody wrote down
 *      is an ordinary diff, and the subject would be measuring taste;
 *   2. `clean` differs from `planted` ONLY in that respect. Two candidates
 *      that differ in size, in shape, or in a second defect let a reviewer
 *      separate them without ever reading the convention, and the reading
 *      would be about diff shape instead.
 *
 * ## What was broken to prove it
 *
 * Counts and case lists predicted before the battery ran, baseline row read
 * first. Mutations applied by hand, reverted, and every file confirmed
 * byte-identical by SHA-256 afterwards — never by `git checkout --`. Over
 * this file alone.
 *
 * | Row | Predicted | Measured | The input on which mutant and original differ |
 * |---|---|---|---|
 * | **baseline** — unmutated | 36 pass, 0 fail | **36 pass, 0 fail** | — |
 * | M1 the plant removed — `planted.ts`'s arm reverted to the baseline's | 3 | **3 of 36**, the three named | a linked worktree with a tracked generator: the plant returns `ok`, the mutant declines `not-repo-root` |
 * | M2 the DA-owned sentence deleted from `CLAUDE.md` | 1 | **1 of 36** | the repository's own `CLAUDE.md`: the convention case reads the sentence, the mutant reads a paraphrase that states no prohibition |
 * | M3 `clean.ts` given the plant too — its worktree arm falls through | 1 | **1 of 36** | the same worktree reading: `clean` declines, the mutant returns `ok`, so the pair stops isolating the convention |
 * | M4 a comment line added to `clean.ts` ABOVE the arm | 1 | **1 of 36** | the two candidate files: the heads are equal, the mutant's are one line apart |
 *
 * M1 is the row that matters, because the three cases it reds are three
 * different claims about the plant — that it grants something, that it
 * grants it relative to `clean` as well as to the baseline, and that the
 * declared line range still contains it. M4 is the one that keeps the pair
 * honest: without it `clean` could acquire a second difference and every
 * other case here would stay green.
