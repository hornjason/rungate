/**
 * #1135 — every fixture below used to be written into the real checkout.
 *
 * `ROOT` was `join(import.meta.dir, "..")`, so `writeTestJson` replaced the
 * live `project-state.json`, the renderer rewrote the live
 * `PROJECT-STATE.md`, one case deleted `project-state.json` outright, and
 * `afterAll` put everything back. Measured, that left the two DA-owned
 * records in 36 distinct states across a single run — one of them ABSENT —
 * and for 48.4% of the run a concurrent reader got a document it could not
 * use. `test/project-state-currency.test.ts` and `test/closing-keywords.test.ts`
 * are deliberately pointed at those live files, and several agents share this
 * checkout.
 *
 * Restoring in `afterAll` is not a fix: the window stays open for the whole
 * run and the originals are lost on a crash. So the fixtures moved to a temp
 * root instead, via the seam `test/project-state-shape.test.ts` already
 * drives — see `test/helpers/project-state-temp-root.ts`.
 *
 * A side effect worth naming: `specs/` in the temp root is EMPTY, so SC
 * promotion is now exactly what each test puts there. Against the real tree
 * these cases were also scanning several hundred committed SC checkboxes,
 * which is where the "21 flips" in the filed issue came from — flips of
 * `"done": false` inside `project-state.json`, not edits to any spec.
 *
 * Guarded by `test/project-state-suite-isolation.test.ts`.
