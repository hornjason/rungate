/**
 * #765: every generated workflow whose job produces a REQUIRED status context
 * must handle `merge_group`, or a merge queue waits forever for a check that
 * never reports.
 *
 * ## Why this is not a style check
 *
 * A merge queue builds a temporary `gh-readonly-queue/<base>/...` ref and waits
 * for the required contexts to report against it. A workflow triggered only by
 * `push` and `pull_request` never runs on that ref. The queue does not fail —
 * it sits pending, with no annotation, no red check and nothing in any log. The
 * repository simply stops merging, and the nearest reading of that symptom is
 * "the queue is busy".
 *
 * That is the `UNMEASURED` shape of `.claude/rules/checks-must-be-able-to-fail.md`:
 * a state reached by something that never ran, indistinguishable from success.
 *
 * ## What this file pins, and why each case exists
 *
 * **Both bodies, not one.** `createCiWorkflows` builds `ciYml` from a ternary on
 * `shardCount` (`lib/scaffold/steps.ts`), so there are two complete CI workflow
 * bodies. The first draft of #765 added the trigger to the unsharded one only.
 * Five generator test files — 91 cases — passed before and after, because none
 * of them distinguishes the two bodies on their trigger block. The sharded body
 * is the one that matters most: the required `test` context is the aggregate
 * job, and that job exists only there.
 *
 * **No branches: filter.** `merge_group` takes no branch list, and the queue ref
 * is not the base branch, so a filter would make the trigger present and inert.
 * That is strictly worse than absent: the file then reads as handling the event
 * while the queue still hangs. The case asserts the key stands alone.
 *
 * **Every generated workflow, read off the generated set (#867).** The cases
 * enumerate what the generator actually wrote into the directory rather than a
 * list of three names typed here, so a fourth generated workflow is covered the
 * day it lands instead of the day somebody remembers to add it.
 *
 * `ai-review.yml` was excluded here until #867, and the exclusion was asserted
 * as a deliberate decision on the reasoning that a merge group has no pull
 * request to review. The reasoning is sound and the conclusion was not: it is
 * an argument about what the job can *do* on the event, and it was applied to
 * whether the job *reports* on it. A required context that never reports is the
 * silent hang this whole file exists to prevent, and `ai-review` is the context
 * a consumer is most likely to require, because it is the only one that reads
 * the code. The argument now lives in the report step, where it decides the
 * verdict — see `test/ai-review-merge-group.test.ts`.
 *
 * ## The cheapest wrong fix, named
 *
 * Hand-edit `.github/workflows/ci.yml` in this repository and stop. The symptom
 * disappears here, the two consumer repos stay broken, and the next re-scaffold
 * overwrites it without reporting anything, because the `test` job is
 * harness-owned.
 *
 * Does this file survive that fix? **Yes, non-vacuously.** Every case below runs
 * the generator into a temp directory and reads what it wrote. A hand edit to
 * this repo's checked-in file changes nothing any case here observes, so they
 * stay red until the generator itself emits the trigger.
