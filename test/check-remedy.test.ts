/**
 * Covers #813: the Tier 1 conformity checks route to the document that
 * explains them, and the pointer is absent where the document is.
 *
 * ## What was broken to prove these can fail
 *
 * Baseline 19 pass / 0 fail; restored and re-verified at 19 pass / 0 fail.
 *
 * | # | Mutation | Result |
 * |---|---|---|
 * | M1 | `ruleDocPointer` returns its sentence unconditionally | **2 fail** |
 * | M2 | `ruleDocPointer` returns `""` unconditionally | **3 fail** |
 * | M3 | `HYGIENE-4`'s `check:` field renamed | **1 fail** |
 * | M4 | one row deleted from `TIER_1` | **1 fail** |
 * | M5 | the `expect` proximity test removed from `routedCheckIds` | **1 fail** |
 * | M6 | `stripJsComments` removed from `routedCheckIds` | **1 fail** |
 * | M7 | `HYGIENE-4` reverted to an unasserted message | **2 fail** |
 * | M8 | the `FIX:` line dropped from `remedyMessage` | **2 fail** |
 *
 * M7 is the row that matters, and it is the one the issue is about: it is
 * what a future agent does when a remedy gets in the way. It separates from
 * M3 on the count — renaming a check loses one row, un-asserting it loses the
 * named row AND the call-site total, because the total counts only asserted
 * calls.
 *
 * **M5 and M6 measured 0 red in the first battery**, when the scan lived in
 * this file and ran only over the three real sources. Both guards were
 * written as obviously necessary and neither changed a single result,
 * because no file in this repo mentions the symbol in a comment or composes
 * a remedy without asserting it. The scan moved into `lib/check-remedy.ts`
 * as `routedCheckIds` so that a planted source could reach them. The
 * mechanism did not change; what changed is that it can now be shown to
 * work.
 *
 * Each of those two has a control beside its witness. A scan that returned
 * `[]` for every input would satisfy both witnesses on its own, which would
 * make this section a description of a test rather than a measurement of one.
