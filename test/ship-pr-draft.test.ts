/**
 * A run that does not ship leaves no mergeable PR behind (#252, criterion 3)
 *
 * Run `wf_e105dd33-220` returned `SHIP_FAILED` and left PR #250 open, not a
 * draft, `mergeable: MERGEABLE`, carrying the `resolveManagedWrite` defect that
 * destroyed a consumer's CI. Nothing had gone wrong with the refusal — the
 * refusal was correct. The problem is WHERE the PR is opened: `ship.js` opens
 * it in the `open-pr` step, and the ship gate, the blocking-grade
 * check, the security staleness refusal and the suite staleness refusal all
 * run AFTER it. Every one of those can refuse with a reviewable PR already
 * sitting on the branch, and a human reading the PR list cannot tell it from
 * one the harness stands behind.
 *
 * The fix is not a cleanup step. A cleanup step is another thing that has to
 * run, on a path that by definition is the one where things stopped running.
 * The PR is opened as a DRAFT and is marked ready only at the terminal, once
 * nothing is left that can refuse — so the default, including the default when
 * the run dies mid-flight or is killed, is the state the run actually earned.
 *
 * Two halves, tested two ways:
 *
 *  - Does `--draft` reach GitHub? `test/github-op.test.ts` answers that
 *    against a loopback server, asserting the request body, not the flag.
 *  - Does the run decide correctly WHETHER to undraft? That is this file, and
 *    the decision function is EXTRACTED BY MARKER AND EXECUTED rather than
 *    grepped — PROJECT-STATE.md records that every mutation surviving a first
 *    pass in this repo has been a source-text assertion.
 *
 * WHAT WAS BROKEN TO PROVE THESE FAIL (.claude/rules/checks-must-be-able-to-fail.md):
 * the mutants in the last describe are built here, on every run, from the real
 * block. Each builder throws if its substitution changes nothing, so a rename
 * aborts this file rather than passing it.
