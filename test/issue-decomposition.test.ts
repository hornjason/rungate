  // created #1716..#1722 with no queue label, and until these cases existed
  // nothing failed if the label stopped arriving.
  //
  // Proved able to fail. Three mutations of `scripts/plan-issues.ts`, each
  // run and reverted, each reddening exactly ONE of the two cases:
  //
  //   | mutation                                   | red                |
  //   |--------------------------------------------|--------------------|
  //   | `label: queueLabel` -> `label: null`       | the case below     |
  //   | `readQueueLabel(root)` -> `null`           | the case below     |
  //   | `readQueueLabel(root)` -> `"engine"`       | the CONTROL below  |
  //
  // The third is why there are two cases and not one. A single case asserting
  // the label arrives is satisfied by spelling `"engine"` in the writer —
  // which fixes the day and builds the *two deciders that agree* shape the
  // docblock on `readQueueLabel` exists to forbid. The control is the only
  // thing that can tell a read value from an invented one.

 *
 * So the whole suite is re-run against a copy of `lib/issue-decomposition.ts`
 * whose one rejection binding is a no-op. `reject(...)` is followed by
 * `continue` at every site, so emptying it does not make a bad row pass: it
 * makes the row **vanish**, which is the exact failure mode the module was
 * written to prevent.
 *
 * **The membership is declared, not counted.** A total alone would be
 * satisfied by eleven unrelated cases going red
