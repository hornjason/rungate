/**
 * `lib/spec-placement.ts` — the placement table, and the milestones derived
 * from it (#1647).
 *
 * Every case here plants a whole document and runs it through the real
 * parser. None of them reimplements the id extraction or the cell split: a
 * control that reimplements the thing it controls proves `Array.filter`
 * works, and it goes green under exactly the mutations that matter
 * (`.claude/rules/checks-must-be-able-to-fail.md`, *two deciders that
 * agree*). That specific mistake was made in this file's sibling, caught by
 * a reviewer on #1647, and is the reason the helper below builds text.
 *
 * ## What was broken to prove each case can fail
 *
 * Each `*_violation` case is paired with a `*_clean` assertion over a
 * document differing in ONE row, so the red is attributable to that row and
 * not to the plant being malformed. The pairs are stated in each case's
 * name. Without the pair, a plant with a typo'd heading reports every
 * criterion unplaced and every case passes for the instrument's reason.
