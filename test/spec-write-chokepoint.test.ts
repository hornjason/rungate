/**
 * #1552 — every `specs/` write goes through `lib/write-spec.ts`, and a raw
 * write primitive aimed at a spec path outside it is named.
 *
 * ## What this replaces, and what it cannot
 *
 * #1286 and #1549 guarded thirteen spec write paths one at a time. The
 * measured forget rate was 2 of 12, and both misses were found by re-deriving
 * the population rather than by any check — because the check was a per-FILE
 * classification sweep, and list membership is not reachability. It failed
 * when a known writer was unclassified; it could not fail when somebody added
 * a new unguarded one, and it was blind to a second write site inside an
 * already-classified file (#1548).
 *
 * The sweep here reads CALL SITES and their target expressions, so both of
 * those holes close. What it still cannot see is a path assembled across more
 * than `EXPANSION_DEPTH` statements, or handed in as a function parameter —
 * `hooks/DocHygiene.hook.ts` is exactly that, and it is carried below as a
 * declared `GUARDED_UPSTREAM` entry with its guard asserted, which is the one
 * thing the old file-level sweep did that this one does not.
 *
 * ## Read the baseline row first
 *
 * `BASELINE` runs before every mutation row. The check is green today with
 * nineteen migrated call sites, so a green reading proves nothing on its own:
 * the rows that matter are the planted violation, the reverted migration, and
 * the mutated decider.
 *
 * ## One decider
 *
 * `mayWrite` in `lib/derived-spec.ts` owns the refusal. `writeSpec` consults
 * it and routes the answer; it holds no comparison of its own. Two guards
 * answering one question are behaviourally one guard and no behavioural test
 * can tell them apart — the fourth shape in
 * `.claude/rules/checks-must-be-able-to-fail.md`. The mutation rows below
 * replace `mayWrite`'s single comparison and watch `writeSpec` flip, which is
 * only possible because there is nothing else in the path to hold it up.
