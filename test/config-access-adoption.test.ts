/**
 * ADR-001 D1, the adoption half (#214).
 *
 * Covers SC-1449, SC-1450, SC-1451, SC-1452 (CONFIG-DIRECTORY-STRUCTURE-SPEC.md).
 *
 * #309 built the two conformity checks ADR-001 specified and never got, with a
 * known-violations ratchet banking the 61 sites that existed on the day. A
 * ratchet is only worth having if someone lowers it; this file is the evidence
 * for the first decrement, and the shape of the evidence is the point.
 *
 * ## Why these are behavioural and not "the file imports the loader"
 *
 * ADR-001 diagnosed its own failure precisely:
 *
 *   > SC-478 and SC-479 are both existence assertions over source text. A
 *   > loader that is written correctly and called by nothing satisfies them
 *   > perfectly. The spec verified that the solution was authored; it never
 *   > verified that it was adopted.
 *
 * So every case below runs the migrated function against a project root on the
 * DIRECTORY layout and asserts it returns the configured value. That assertion
 * is false on `main`: all six sites read `.claude/rungate.json` and nothing
 * else, so a directory-layout consumer got `{}`, `"project"` and the built-in
 * defaults from them — silently, with no error and no warning. A re-import of
 * the old reader would turn every one of these red.
 *
 * ## The control
 *
 * A fixture that only proves "directory works" is satisfied by a reader that
 * ignores the monolith, which would be a new bug wearing the fix's clothes.
 * Each accessor is therefore run against BOTH layouts over the same authored
 * values, and the two results are compared to each other rather than to a
 * literal.
