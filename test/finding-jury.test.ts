/**
 * The verifier jury: quorum, category filter, severity tags (#1187).
 *
 * Two things in here are doing real work and the rest is bookkeeping.
 *
 * `JURY-1` holds the **refusals**: a short group, a repeated verifier and a
 * non-majority quorum each report UNMEASURED rather than deciding, which is
 * #1187's doctrine applied to the one input that arrives as a judgement.
 *
 * `JURY-4` is the **planted control for the category filter**, and it is the
 * row to read before any of the corpus numbers. The filter drops zero
 * findings across 427 real issues on this tracker; a filter that cannot fire
 * at all would report exactly the same zero, and nothing else in this file
 * tells those two readings apart
 * (`.claude/rules/checks-must-be-able-to-fail.md`, the inert-knob shape).
