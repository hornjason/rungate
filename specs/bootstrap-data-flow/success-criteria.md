## Success Criteria

<!-- Phase subheaders route SCs to test files automatically. -->
<!-- The meta-test (test/meta-sc-coverage.test.ts) reads these headers. -->
<!-- To add a new SC: paste it under the correct ### Phase header. -->

### Phase 0 — Scaffold Output

- [ ] SC-1: Bootstrap Phase 1 (CODE-MAP + rungate) completes before Phase 2 (AGENTS.md + agents/)
- [x] SC-2: rungate.json consumers field populated from CODE-MAP consumer scan, not hardcoded patterns
- [x] SC-3: AGENTS.md environment section reads from rungate.json (not hardcoded)
- [x] SC-4: Zero hardcoded ports/URLs in ship.js — all from rungate.json fields
- [x] SC-5: Zero hardcoded commands in ship.js — all from rungate.json fields
- [x] SC-6: Zero hardcoded project names in ship.js — all from args or rungate.json
- [x] SC-8: All ship.js inline prompts >5 lines extracted to prompts/*.md templates
- [x] SC-11: Re-running scaffold always regenerates AGENTS.md from scratch — no audit-only path, no preserved sections. User rules belong in CLAUDE.md
- [x] SC-15: rungate.json generation falls back from Makefile → package.json → null for each field
- [x] SC-16: Null config fields cause workflow steps to SKIP (not error, not spawn rogue agents)
- [x] SC-17: AGENTS.md is under [150] lines — scaffold WARNS if over
- [ ] SC-18: Empty sections omitted from AGENTS.md (no consumers = no Consumers section)
- [x] SC-19: CLAUDE.md contains [@AGENTS.md] bridge for cross-tool compatibility
- [ ] SC-20: src/index.ts exists (new code projects get stub as agent starting point)
- [x] SC-21: rungate.json has no hardcoded port numbers — all detected from Makefile/config or null
- [x] SC-24: Conformity test calls all 9 suites (scaffold, spec-discovery, spec-drift, doc-hygiene, agent-validation, fallow, constraint-candidates, package-validation, tsconfig-validation)
- [x] SC-25: AGENTS.md Commands section includes all harness commands (bun test, tsc, conformity, sync-tests, create-spec, create-adr, extract-constraints, re-scaffold)
- [x] SC-26: Spec template in project matches harness version — scaffold updates on re-run
- [x] SC-27: sync-spec-tests reads project's specs/ directory (not just harness specs)
- [x] SC-37: Every agent brief includes Core Principles block (verify-before-asserting, no gaps, read AGENTS.md)
- [x] SC-39: CODE-MAP.md staleness detected by git SHA comparison — regenerated when src/ has commits since last scan, not by arbitrary time/count thresholds
- [x] SC-40: Scaffold creates/verifies .gitignore with full security template (node_modules, dist, .env*, .rungate, *.pem, *.key, credentials.json, service-account*)
- [x] SC-73: package.json has required fields (name, type:module, scripts.test, devDependencies.rungate) — scaffold adds missing, never overwrites existing
- [x] SC-74: tsconfig.json has recommended fields (strict:true) — scaffold WARNs if missing, never overwrites
- [x] SC-75: Spec frontmatter has required fields (doc-type, status, testable, governs) — Spec Discovery FAILs if missing
- [x] SC-76: ADR frontmatter has required fields (doc-type:adr, status, created) — Doc Hygiene FAILs if missing
- [x] SC-77: `bunx rungate create-spec` creates spec with all required frontmatter fields pre-populated
- [x] SC-78: `bunx rungate create-adr` creates ADR with all required frontmatter fields pre-populated
- [x] SC-80: Phase 0 creates all 10 directories + all static files BEFORE any scan runs (Phase 1)
- [x] SC-82: .github/workflows/ci.yml exists (harness-owned, always regenerated from template + rungate.json)
- [x] SC-83: .github/workflows/gates.yml exists (harness-owned, always regenerated from template + rungate.json)
- [x] SC-84: CI workflow runs all conformity suites that `bun test` runs (same checks, CI-enforced)
- [x] SC-85: Gates workflow includes secret scan (HYGIENE-12) as CI check on every PR
- [x] SC-86: CI workflows read runner, bunVersion, branches from rungate.json ci section — defaults used when null
- [x] SC-87: CI workflow files include "Managed by rungate" header directing users to rungate.json for customization
- [x] SC-88: All 9 ship workflow prompt templates exist in harness prompts/ (discovery, marcus, quinn, rook, serena, aditi, environment, container-rebuild, container-verify)
- [x] SC-89: All 11 Layer 1 methodology templates exist in harness prompts/ (rca, blast-radius, prevention, regression, read-before-write, quinn-decision-tree, evidence-hierarchy, ac-format, coding-principles, testing-strategy, escalation-decision-tree)
- [x] SC-90: Brief-assembler embeds relevant Layer 1 methodology templates into per-agent briefs at ship time
- [x] SC-91: scripts/git-hooks/pre-commit exists (the tracked source the scaffold installs into .git/hooks; secret scan HYGIENE-12, in-repo not global). Asserts the template, not the installed copy: .git/ is not version-controlled, so an SC naming .git/hooks/pre-commit passes in a working tree that happens to have it installed and fails in every fresh clone and in CI (#225)
- [x] SC-92: scripts/git-hooks/pre-push exists (the tracked source the scaffold installs into .git/hooks; conformity test, in-repo not global). Asserts the template, not the installed copy, for the reason given on SC-91 (#225)
- [ ] SC-93: All project hooks, scripts, and workflows are self-contained in repo — no global dependencies
- [ ] SC-94: AGENTS.md has section [Where to Create Things] listing correct location for every file type agents create
- [ ] SC-95: AGENTS.md has section [Available MCP Servers] listing MCP servers configured for the project with tool names
- [x] SC-97: Pre-flight checks git repo (git init if not), package.json (bun init if not), .gitignore (create if not)
- [x] SC-98: Pre-flight runs BEFORE Phase 0 — .gitignore exists before any git add
- [x] SC-99: Post-scaffold commits all harness files when `--commit` is passed — opt-in since #216, because a scaffold run must not write to a consumer's git history unasked
- [x] SC-100: Post-scaffold commit only runs if there are actual changes (no empty commits), and refuses outright on a tree holding work the scaffold did not generate
- [x] SC-101: rungate.json uses field-level merge — auto-detected fields overwritten, manual fields preserved
- [x] SC-107: Makefile fallback chain: each field tries Makefile → package.json → null in order
- [ ] SC-114: AGENTS.md has section [Research Tools] listing available tools with usage examples
- [x] SC-115: Coding principles reference doc (deep modules, boundary validation, etc.) ships with harness and is referenced in Marcus briefs
- [x] SC-116: Coding principles doc auto-updated via Context7 or research on harness update — not static training data
- [x] SC-117: Testing strategy reference doc (PBT, contract tests, tautological trap) ships with harness and is referenced in Marcus briefs
- [x] SC-118: Writer/verifier separation enforced — gate checks that test author agent != code author agent (SC-66 mechanical)
- [x] SC-119: Test assertions reference AC thresholds, not implementation details — gate WARNs on test files with zero AC-ID references
- [x] SC-120: Context loading follows 5-layer architecture — CLAUDE.md → AGENTS.md → skills (on demand) → agent frontmatter → brief
- [x] SC-121: Agent frontmatter `skills` field preloads role-specific methodology — Marcus gets coding-principles + testing-strategy, Quinn gets journey-format
- [x] SC-122: AGENTS.md contains ONLY non-inferrable details — no info agents could discover by reading src/ or running commands
- [x] SC-123: .github/copilot-instructions.md exists (created if missing, never overwritten — scaffold skips on existing)
- [x] SC-124: rungate.json envVars field populated from .env.example if it exists — null if no .env.example
- [x] SC-125: CODE-MAP.md frontmatter includes scan-paths array listing directories scanned
- [ ] SC-126: AGENTS.md has section [Code Style] auto-detected from runtime (Bun/Node), language (TS/JS), module system (ESM/CJS)
- [ ] SC-128: AGENTS.md has section [Harness-Managed Files] with file/customize/don't table
- [x] SC-138: Agent briefs cap at 10 essential rules per Layer 1 template — instruction stacking beyond 16 degrades compliance 50%+
- [x] SC-139: AGENTS.md Rules section at most [200] words (excluding tables/headers) — always-on context must be lean
- [x] SC-140: Brief structure: Core Principles at START, ACs at END — methodology in middle (mitigates "Lost in the Middle" attention decay)
- [x] SC-141: Templates use positive framing ("use X" not "don't use Y") — negative instructions capped at 10 per brief
- [x] SC-142: Every Layer 1 template includes at least one code example per principle — examples outperform descriptions
- [x] SC-143: Each template declares activation mode: always-on, file-pattern, agent-decided, or manual
- [x] SC-144: Rule lifecycle: every rule in AGENTS.md has a `since` date in comment — rules older than 90 days without revalidation flagged at re-scaffold
- [x] SC-145: Brief-assembler orders sections: identity (role) → principles → methodology → ACs → verification commands — never methodology after ACs
- [x] SC-146: Every agent brief categorizes rules into three tiers: Always Do (autonomous), Ask First (needs approval), Never Do (hard stops) — gate validates "Never Do" items mechanically
- [x] SC-147: rungate.json includes `harnessVersion` (semver from harness package.json) and `scaffoldedAt` (ISO timestamp) — projects know what version they were scaffolded with
- [x] SC-148: Conformity test WARNs when installed harness version differs from `harnessVersion` in rungate.json — signals re-scaffold needed
- [x] SC-159: AGENTS.md has section [Commands] with `Check findings | cat .rungate/conformity-findings.json` row
- [x] SC-160: AGENTS.md Quick Reference includes "After test failures, read `.rungate/conformity-findings.json` for structured findings with fix commands"
- [ ] SC-251: AGENTS.md Documentation Routing auto-detects docs/ subdirectories and lists them with file counts
- [ ] SC-252: AGENTS.md Where to Create Things lists all doc types (Specs, ADRs, Research, Council, Guides) with required frontmatter fields
- [ ] SC-253: Re-scaffold on RunGate itself produces 0 warnings and correct AGENTS.md without hand editing
- [ ] SC-254: Cross-tool user rules via tool-agnostic PROJECT-RULES.md referenced from AGENTS.md (future enhancement — CLAUDE.md for now)

### Phase 1 — Knowledge Extraction + Doc Hygiene

- [x] SC-12: Bootstrap scans docs for non-inferrable rule candidates using signal phrases
- [x] SC-13: Extracted candidates presented for user confirmation before writing to AGENTS.md
- [x] SC-14: Staleness uses git log date with per-type thresholds (ADR exempt, spec 90d, guide 180d)
- [x] SC-22: Re-scaffold reports stale constraints (Hard Constraints referencing deleted files)
- [x] SC-23: Re-scaffold reports line count if AGENTS.md exceeds 150 lines
- [x] SC-30: Misplaced spec/ADR/doc files are FAIL not WARN (HYGIENE-7/8/9)
- [x] SC-106: Doc lifecycle: stale docs (beyond threshold) flagged for archive to reference/ — per-type thresholds applied
- [x] SC-137: Rejected constraint candidates logged to reference/rejected-constraints.md with content-hash dedup — same candidate never resurfaces
- [x] SC-149: Conformity findings written to `.rungate/conformity-findings.json` with structured format (ruleId, severity, file, message, fixCommand)
- [x] SC-150: Every FAIL finding includes a `fixCommand` — agents can execute it directly to resolve the issue
- [x] SC-154: Unified findings report includes `constraintCandidates` array with rule, source, hash, and status (pending/applied/rejected)
- [x] SC-155: Unified findings report includes `staleness` array with file, daysSince, threshold, and type
- [x] SC-156: HYGIENE-6 pipes extract-constraints results (candidates + staleness) into unified findings report — nothing lost to stdout
- [x] SC-157: Gate runner reads `.rungate/conformity-findings.json` after `bun test` completes and prints structured output (findings with fix commands, candidates, stale docs)
- [x] SC-158: Gate runner stores conformityFindings in workflow-state.json — agents read fix commands from workflow-state, not test output
- [x] SC-151: HYGIENE-7 detects spec files at root (not in specs/) and produces FAIL with `mv` fix command
- [x] SC-152: HYGIENE-8 detects ADR files outside docs/adr/ and produces FAIL with `mv` fix command
- [x] SC-153: HYGIENE-9 detects doc files at root (not in docs/, not allowlisted) and produces FAIL with `mv` fix command

### Phase 1.5 — Context Quality

- [ ] SC-161: Scaffold assembles agent briefs from prompts/*.md content files — no instruction text hardcoded in scaffold-project.ts
- [ ] SC-162: Every prompts/*.md file referenced by a brief template exists and contains ≥10 lines of content
- [ ] SC-163: Modifying a prompts/*.md file changes scaffold output on next run without editing scaffold source code

- [ ] SC-164: Agent brief Environment URLs match rungate.json dev section — extends SC-3 to brief-level validation with fixCommand "Re-run scaffold"
- [ ] SC-165: Quinn brief frontmatter includes tools: [Bash, Read, mcp__playwright__*]
- [ ] SC-166: Agent brief environment values match rungate.json dev section — mismatch produces FAIL with fixCommand "Re-run scaffold" (brief-level extension of SC-3/SC-4)
- [ ] SC-167: AGENTS.md Specs table governs and testable fields match actual spec frontmatter — cross-references AGENTS.md routing table against spec file metadata (distinct from SC-75 spec file validation)
- [x] SC-168: CODE-MAP.md exists for code projects and is under 3,000 tokens — over-budget produces WARN
- [ ] SC-169: scaffold output .git/hooks/ files match mode 755 and contain scaffold-generated shebang line

- [ ] SC-170: Tier 1 files containing content not produced by scaffold trigger WARN OWNERSHIP-TIER1-EXTRA with fixCommand to relocate (extends SC-104 with extra-content detection)
- [ ] SC-173: Ownership tier assignment for every harness-touched file declared in lib/ownership-manifest.ts

- [ ] SC-174: Conformity wraps ctxlint tokens/* rule — instruction files exceeding thresholds produce WARN
- [ ] SC-175: Conformity wraps agentsmd claude-length-warn — CLAUDE.md beyond 200 lines produces WARN
- [ ] SC-176: Hard Constraints >20 rules produces WARN citing instruction stacking collapse
- [ ] SC-177: Budget findings include token count from ctxlint or ccinspect — RunGate does not implement own tokenizer

- [ ] SC-178: lib/conformity.ts contains [ctxlint, spawnSync]
- [ ] SC-179: lib/conformity.ts contains [agentsmd, spawnSync]
- [ ] SC-180: lib/conformity.ts contains [agnix, spawnSync]
- [ ] SC-181: Conformity runs RepoRails via Bun.spawnSync with REPORAILS-{ruleId} prefix
- [ ] SC-182: agentsmd score stored in findings JSON scores.agentsmd field
- [x] SC-183: External tools optional — if not installed, WARN TOOL-NOT-INSTALLED-{name}
- [x] SC-184: External tool findings include fixCommand from tool's fixHint/suggestion/fix field
- [ ] SC-230: Conformity runs ccinspect via Bun.spawnSync with CCINSPECT-{ruleId} prefix (56 rules: contradictions, scope/precedence, session analytics)

- [ ] SC-185: Agent instruction files contain no TODO/FIXME — wrap agentsmd todo-rot
- [ ] SC-186: No contradictory instructions across files — wrap ccinspect contradiction-keywords
- [ ] SC-187: No secrets/credentials in agent instruction files — wrap ctxlint content-secrets
- [ ] SC-188: Conformity wraps ctxlint dead-hook — settings.json hook command paths resolve to present files
- [ ] SC-189: No machine-specific absolute paths in instruction files — wrap agentsmd/agnix
- [ ] SC-190: Total instruction count across always-loaded files under 150 (distinct from SC-17 line count and SC-139 word count — this counts discrete instructions)
- [ ] SC-191: Agent briefs reference AGENTS.md — never duplicate Hard Constraints inline
- [ ] SC-192: Conformity flags >70% token overlap between brief and AGENTS.md as SPRAWL-DUPLICATE
- [ ] SC-193: AGENTS.md workflow section references .rungate/conformity-findings.json
- [ ] SC-231: Generated content in scaffold output prefers positive framing — negative instructions ("never do X") without positive alternatives ("instead, do Y") produce WARN

- [ ] SC-194: Generated content passes inferability test — discoverable content produces WARN INFERABLE-CONTENT
- [ ] SC-195: Conformity cross-references instructions against CODE-MAP.md — nonexistent entities produce FAIL CODEBASE-GROUNDING

- [ ] SC-196: Scaffold runs external tool checks after generating briefs before writing final output
- [ ] SC-197: Post-generation quality check errors trigger regeneration — max 5 iterations
- [ ] SC-198: Composite quality threshold configurable in rungate.json — weights budget over coverage (agentsmd coverage excluded per SC-A6)
- [ ] SC-199: Final scores written to .rungate/scaffold-score.json
- [ ] SC-200: Generate-score loop logs iteration findings count — monotonically decreasing proves convergence

- [ ] SC-201: Hard Constraints contains only human-reviewed rules — auto-extracted go to review queue per SC-13 confirmation flow
- [x] SC-202: New rules include provenance comment: source incident and date recurred
- [ ] SC-232: Constraint extraction enforces second-occurrence rule — rules promoted to Hard Constraints only after recurring in 2+ incidents (Anthropic best practice)

- [ ] SC-203: Postinstall checks .rungate-version stamp — re-scaffolds only when version changes
- [ ] SC-204: GitHub Actions workflow detects rungate version change and runs scaffold --refresh

- [ ] SC-233: Scaffold-generated content checked for contradiction against existing user-written content (Hard Constraints vs generated Environment, brief vs AGENTS.md routing) — distinct from sprawl-duplicate (SC-192)
- [ ] SC-234: External tool versions recorded in .rungate/tool-versions.json on each run — version mismatch from previous run produces INFO
- [ ] SC-255: Agent briefs reference prompts/*.md via pointer section, not inline injection — brief body under 120 lines excluding frontmatter
- [ ] SC-256: CODE-MAP.md includes function signatures and execution order for scripts/ files over 500 lines
- [ ] SC-257: docs/research/ files have doc-type: research frontmatter with governs field

### Phase 2 — Gate Enforcement + Ship Behavior

- [x] SC-7: Container-rebuild agent NOT spawned when prod.rebuild is null
- [ ] SC-9: rungate-schema.ts includes test.rebuild, test.start, test.stop, test.apiBase fields
- [x] SC-10: Schema fields dev.typeCheck, prod.smokeTest, contextDocs read by at least one workflow
- [x] SC-28: Scope gate runs project conformity tests — FAIL blocks scope
- [x] SC-29: Verify gate runs project conformity tests — FAIL blocks verify
- [x] SC-31: Scope gate captures test baseline (pass/fail count + failing test names)
- [x] SC-32: Verify gate compares test count — fail increase = regression = FAIL
- [x] SC-33: Pre-existing test failures auto-filed as GitHub issues with "pre-existing" label
- [x] SC-34: Found issues during ship cycle either fixed, filed, or explicitly scoped out
- [x] SC-35: `bunx rungate create-spec` creates spec at specs/ with correct frontmatter
- [x] SC-36: `bunx rungate create-adr` creates ADR at docs/adr/ with auto-incremented number
- [x] SC-38: Ship cycle runs scaffold after verify gate PASS — auto-refresh CODE-MAP, briefs, AGENTS.md
- [x] SC-41: Conformity checks for secret patterns in staged/committed files (HYGIENE-12) — catches secrets on ALL tiers including LIGHT
- [x] SC-42: Completed slugs (DONE + proven) auto-archived after 24h
- [x] SC-43: Archived slugs deleted after 30 days
- [x] SC-44: Ship cycle checks for existing slug by issue number before creating new one
- [x] SC-48: ACs use Given/When/Then format with four required fields: trigger, output, verify command, exclusions
- [x] SC-49: Every AC has an executable verification command (oracle) — not prose description
- [x] SC-50: Evidence hierarchy enforced per AC — minimum tier: CODE→A, UI→B, BUG-FIX→S, static→C supplementary only
- [x] SC-51: Self-attestation (tier F) in any AC evidence = automatic FAIL regardless of other evidence
- [x] SC-52: Garbage test applied to every AC — "Could garbage data pass this?" If yes, AC is rejected
- [x] SC-53: RCA section required in Marcus brief for bug-fix issues — rootCause, prediction, predictionVerified
- [x] SC-54: Gate checks RCA fields populated on bug-fix issues — empty rootCause = WARN (graduates to FAIL after 30d)
- [x] SC-55: Quinn briefs use typed journey format — steps with action, wait_for, typed assertions, on_fail
- [x] SC-56: Quinn primary perception is browser_snapshot (a11y tree), screenshots only on FAIL or visual checks
- [x] SC-57: Quinn circuit breaker — 3 consecutive FAIL steps abort journey with partial results
- [x] SC-58: Proof-of-fix includes negative control (revert fix, confirm bug returns) for S-tier evidence
- [x] SC-59: Blast radius section in Marcus brief — filesRead ≥ filesChanged enforced
- [x] SC-60: Read-before-write ratio ≥ 3:1 — gate checks read vs write token count
- [x] SC-61: Brief-assembler generates per-role templates (Marcus, Quinn, Rook, Serena, Aditi) from three layers
- [x] SC-62: Templates are three-layered: harness-generic + project-config (rungate.json) + issue-specific (ACs)
- [x] SC-63: Spec content hash tracked — hash mismatch at gate = FAIL (tests must match current spec)
- [x] SC-64: Test count post ≥ pre at verify gate — decrease = FAIL "tests removed, verify no gaming"
- [x] SC-65: Prevention-oriented fixes: guard at boundary, type narrowing, pattern audit for same-bug-class
- [x] SC-66: Writer and verifier are separate agents — same agent cannot write code AND verify its own ACs
- [x] SC-67: Quinn journey steps auto-generated from UI-type ACs by brief-assembler
- [x] SC-68: Evidence without assertion = tier F — screenshot taken but nothing checked = self-attestation
- [x] SC-79: Conformity includes `runPackageValidation` check for package.json required fields
- [x] SC-81: Phase 0 file creation is additive — never overwrites existing content, only adds missing fields/entries
- [x] SC-96: rungate.json `mcp` section declares MCP servers available to agents — scaffold includes in agent briefs
- [x] SC-102: Re-scaffold auto-fixes broken refs, unlisted specs, missing CODE-MAP ref, and pages drift — not just reports them
- [x] SC-103: Evidence-to-tier mapping implemented in gate — evidenceMethod.type maps to correct tier per mapping table
- [x] SC-104: File ownership model enforced — Tier 1 (harness-owned) always regenerated, Tier 2 (co-owned/hybrid) preserves user sections across re-scaffold, Tier 3 (user-owned) validated for structure only — scaffold never writes to them
- [x] SC-105: Scaffold is idempotent — running from scratch produces same result as re-scaffold (Core Principle 6)
- [ ] SC-108: Quinn journey stored in slug directory (~/.rungate/{slug}/quinn-journey.yaml) — ephemeral, follows slug lifecycle
- [x] SC-109: Fix-on-find: silently dropped issues = FAIL at verify gate, not WARN
- [x] SC-110: Port allocation for parallel worktrees checks for collisions before assigning offset
- [x] SC-111: Escalation decision tree embedded in every agent brief — agents know research tools exist
- [x] SC-112: Circuit breaker iteration 2 requires research tool invocation before next attempt — gate checks research evidence exists before allowing iteration 3
- [x] SC-113: rungate.json `research` section declares available research tools — brief-assembler includes only available tools
- [x] SC-127: All 3 gate prompt templates exist in harness prompts/ (ac-adversary.md, evidence-validator.md, prove-reproducer.md)
- [x] SC-129: Gate WARNs if a new module file has more exported functions than internal functions (shallow module signal)
- [x] SC-130: Gate WARNs if a module with >3 importers has no contract test
- [x] SC-131: Anti-criteria (SC-A*) use absence verification — Verify command must confirm absence, not presence
- [x] SC-132: Tier D evidence (grep) capped at 25% of total evidence portfolio per issue — gate FAIL if exceeded
- [x] SC-133: Brief-assembler rejects Quinn journeys over 8 steps and auto-splits into multiple journeys with entry conditions
- [x] SC-134: Files changed outside brief's listed files → WARN "Files changed outside brief: {list}"
- [ ] SC-135: Gate cross-validates proofOfFix in workflow-state.json against prove-evidence.json — mismatch = FAIL

### Phase 3 — Parallel Work

- [x] SC-45: Container lock checked mechanically (Makefile target, not behavioral rule) — blocks rebuild/prove-up if lock exists
- [x] SC-46: Ship workflow supports worktree isolation for parallel execution
- [x] SC-47: Container lock released mechanically after test completion (cleanup triggers next queued issue)
- [x] SC-69: Parallel work: file-set overlap detection before assigning concurrent issues to agents
- [x] SC-70: Parallel work: port/namespace isolation beyond git worktree file isolation
- [x] SC-71: Parallel work: cap concurrent agents at 5 per session (diminishing returns beyond)
- [x] SC-72: Parallel work: sequential merge with CI verification between each PR
- [x] SC-136: Worktree branches use deterministic naming: issue-{N}-{slug}

### Phase 4 — Knowledge Mining

- [ ] SC-205: rungate temporal-coupling command analyzes git co-change history → .rungate/temporal-couplings.json
- [ ] SC-206: Temporal coupling JSON has fileA, fileB, coChanges, hasImportLink, auto-generated rule
- [ ] SC-207: File pairs ≥10 co-changes with hasImportLink: false produce candidate rules routed to review queue (SC-201 flow) — not auto-inserted into briefs
- [ ] SC-208: Scaffold reads temporal-couplings.json and includes only review-approved coupling rules (status=applied) in briefs

- [ ] SC-209: rungate analyze-deps runs dependency-cruiser → .rungate/dependency-analysis.json
- [ ] SC-210: Circular deps produce WARN — lists participating modules and hub module
- [ ] SC-211: Orphan modules produce INFO with fixCommand
- [ ] SC-212: Module boundary violations (data importing routes) produce WARN — graduates to FAIL after validation across projects

- [ ] SC-213: rungate analyze-dead-code runs Knip → .rungate/dead-code.json filtered for entry points
- [ ] SC-214: Knip entry points configurable in rungate.json analysis.entryPoints
- [ ] SC-215: Unused backend files produce WARN DEAD-FILE
- [ ] SC-216: Unresolved imports produce FAIL BROKEN-IMPORT (Knip-specific detection — distinct from fallow suite SC-24 which uses different heuristics)

- [ ] SC-217: rungate analyze-hotspots computes hotspot score → .rungate/hotspots.json
- [ ] SC-218: Top 5 hotspot files produce INFO — surfaced in briefs as "high-risk files"

- [ ] SC-219: Tier 1 regex pre-filter uses signal-phrases.ts
- [ ] SC-220: Tier 2 heuristic scorer assigns 0-5 using 5 checks (modal+action, actor subject, list item, imperative, code reference)
- [ ] SC-221: Score ≥5 auto-promoted to high-confidence
- [ ] SC-222: Score 3-4 sent to Tier 3 LLM classification
- [ ] SC-223: Score ≤2 auto-filtered as noise
- [ ] SC-224: Tier 3 LLM uses ≤200 tokens per candidate, total under $0.05
- [ ] SC-225: Deduplicated cross-file — same rule appears once with all sources
- [ ] SC-226: Top 20 candidates in findings JSON constraintCandidates array (extends SC-154), full list in .rungate/all-constraints.json

- [ ] SC-227: Candidates have status field: pending/applied/rejected/deferred + reviewedAt
- [ ] SC-228: Output adapts to AgentGrit inbox Pattern type when installed
- [ ] SC-229: Candidates unreviewed >90 days auto-transition to deferred

### Phase 5 — Instruction Compliance

- [ ] SC-236: `rungate test-navigability` spawns fresh agent with standard task, auditor scores transcript → .rungate/navigability-score.json (behavioral)
- [ ] SC-237: navigability-score.json schema includes fileLoadRate, directHitRate, complianceRate, toolCallCount, canaryResults, timestamp
- [x] SC-238: Canary values planted in generated files are checked by auditor — score = canaries triggered correctly / total canaries
- [ ] SC-239: `rungate rule-health` cross-references instruction quality (agnix/RepoRails scores) with behavioral compliance (auditor data) → .rungate/rule-health.json with KEEP/RETIRE/FAILING/STALE verdicts
- [x] SC-240: `lib/compliance.ts → runTemplateCompliance()` runs agnix + RepoRails on instruction files (prompts/*.md, AGENTS.md, .claude/agents/*.md, CLAUDE.md) via Bun.spawnSync — consumes their JSON output, does NOT reimplement scoring with regex
- [ ] SC-241: `lib/compliance.ts → runGeneratedCompliance()` scores generated files after scaffold, compares against template baseline — scaffold cannot degrade instruction quality (score drop >0.05 = FAIL)
- [ ] SC-242: `lib/compliance.ts → runBehavioralCompliance()` spawns fresh agent + auditor, checks each instruction followed or not, produces compliance-score.json with per-instruction rates (behavioral)
- [ ] SC-243: Hill climb loop: FAIL instruction → apply 7 compliance factors to rewrite → re-score → max 5 iterations → escalate to mechanical (hook/gate) if still failing
- [ ] SC-244: 7 compliance factors scored per instruction: specific (names file/command), strong-modal (must/always/never), positive (do Y not just don't X), observable (grep-able), positioned (top 20%), short-file (<120 lines), temporal-anchor (BEFORE/AFTER trigger)
- [x] SC-245: Compliance surface is exactly 4 file types: prompts/*.md, AGENTS.md, .claude/agents/*.md, CLAUDE.md — NOT hooks, workflows, CODE-MAP, .gitignore, tests
- [ ] SC-246: Instructions that fail behavioral compliance after 5 hill-climb iterations escalate to mechanical enforcement (hook or gate) with ESCALATED-TO-MECHANICAL tag
- [ ] SC-247: Compliance report written to .rungate/compliance-report.json with layer, surface, per-file scores, overall score, findings with factor/severity/suggestion
- [ ] SC-248: Post-completion auditor spawns after every agent (Marcus, Quinn, Rook) — reads full transcript, classifies each action as FOUND-FROM-REPO / HAD-TO-DISCOVER / GOT-WRONG / MISSED, outputs to .rungate/navigability-score.json (behavioral)
- [x] SC-249: Agent briefs load only when spawned with matching `agentType` — ship/prove workflows must use `agentType: 'marcus'` not `'Engineer'`, matching `.claude/agents/{name}.md` filename
- [ ] SC-250: Five-layer measurement model: (1) file loading — right files read, (2) content routing — pointers resolve, (3) prompt compliance — instructions followed, (4) context cost — tokens burned, (5) drift — trend across runs

### Anti-Criteria

- [ ] SC-A1: No workflow file imports or references values from a specific project (DDB, asaCommandCenter, etc.)
- [ ] SC-A2: No hardcoded file paths in rungate.json generation (no `dashboard/src/App.tsx`, no `callGemini` patterns)
- [ ] SC-A3: No references to "PAI" in lock files, work dirs, or runtime paths — all use "rungate" naming
- [ ] SC-A4: Generated briefs minimize inferable content — any included inferable content requires source justification (convenience, performance, context reduction)
- [ ] SC-A5: External tool findings never silently dropped — tool errors produce WARN, not silence
- [ ] SC-A6: Composite scoring never rewards inferable heading presence (agentsmd coverage excluded from threshold)

## Evaluated Concerns

Concerns raised during spec review, evaluated, and documented for future reference:

| Concern | Verdict | Reasoning |
|---------|---------|-----------|
| Framework changes (Hono→Express) | Not a gap | Re-scaffold + CODE-MAP detects whatever's in src/. Agent briefs regenerate with new structure |
| Monorepo support | Future work | Single-project repos are current target. Nested AGENTS.md per package is future scope |
| CI/CD setup | Handled | Harness creates ci.yml + gates.yml with quality gates. Custom CI (deploy, release) is project-specific |
| Branch protection / PR templates | Out of scope | Project-specific GitHub settings, not harness concern |
| Version migration (harness major bump) | Handled | `bun update rungate` — conformity tests catch breaking changes immediately |
| Collaborator onboarding | Handled | `bun install` gets devDep, `bun test` verifies conformity. No separate setup step |
| First git push | Fixed by SC-40 | .gitignore ensures clean first push |
| Dependency management (bun.lockb) | Handled | Standard bun behavior — lockb committed, node_modules gitignored |
| Mutation testing for test quality | Future work | AI tests: 91% coverage but 34% mutation score. Meta's approach raised to 89.5%. Valuable but heavyweight — test count comparison is minimum viable gate for now |
| LLM-as-judge for verification | Not adopted | 4 known bias modes (length, position, self-preference, non-determinism). Mechanical gates preferred over LLM judgment |
| Agent teams / swarm mode | Future work | Claude Code agent teams in research preview. Current harness uses single-agent-per-role. Parallel work via worktrees |
| Merge queue tooling (Graphite/Mergify) | Future work | Merge queue becomes bottleneck at scale. Current: sequential manual merge. Worth evaluating when parallel work is routine |
| Visual regression testing (Percy/Chromatic) | Future work | Pixel-diff tools exist but add infra complexity. A11y-first assertion covers functional; visual regression is supplementary |
| Context window management for long journeys | Handled by design | Quinn journeys capped at 5-8 steps. Instruction compliance decays from 73% at turn 5 to 33% by turn 16 (Gamage 2026) |

## Cautions

- Bootstrap Phase 1 depends on fallow being installed. If fallow fails, CODE-MAP.md should still generate from other scans (routes, components, dirs) — fallow sections empty, not entire file missing.
- rungate.json consumers field: auto-detection from CODE-MAP may miss consumers that are dynamically imported or configured at runtime. Manual override must be preserved on re-scan.
- Hard Constraints in AGENTS.md must survive regeneration — they're the one section that can't be auto-detected from code. **CRITICAL (council finding):** The preservation regex must handle Hard Constraints as the last section — the lookahead `(?=\n## |\s*$)` handles this (fixed).
- Prompt templates with ${VAR} placeholders: if a variable is undefined (field missing from config), the template should show a clear placeholder or instruction, not leave a raw ${VAR} string in the agent prompt.
- `rejected-constraints.md` must use content-hash dedup so rejections survive line-number changes across doc edits. Prevents the same false positive from resurfacing on every re-scan.
- No `--auto-accept` flag on extract-constraints. 70% false positive rate means human review is mandatory. `--dry-run` is the default.
- AGENTS.md over 150 lines: research shows 20-23% inference cost increase with no behavior improvement. LLM-generated context files decrease performance by 3% (ETH Zurich). Keep it concise, human-written, and focused on non-inferrable details.
- Scaffold partial failure: if scaffold fails halfway (e.g., CODE-MAP generated but rungate.json errors out), the project may have stale data. Recovery: re-run scaffold — it's idempotent, each file is independently valid. No rollback mechanism needed because each step overwrites cleanly.
- Secrets on LIGHT tier: LIGHT tier skips Rook (security scan). Without HYGIENE-12 (secret pattern check in conformity), an agent could commit an API key through LIGHT without any mechanical catch. HYGIENE-12 runs on ALL tiers via `bun test`, closing this gap.
- .gitignore on new projects: pre-flight creates .gitignore from full security template BEFORE `bun init` runs, ensuring secrets are excluded from the first commit. On existing projects, scaffold verifies required entries and appends missing ones.
- RCA WARN→FAIL graduation: SC-54 starts as WARN to avoid blocking existing workflows. After 30 days of data collection, evaluate false positive rate. If <10%, graduate to FAIL. If >10%, refine the check before graduating.
- Evidence hierarchy adoption: existing workflows have grep-heavy evidence. SC-50 enforcement should not retroactively break passing issues. Apply to NEW issues only — existing workflow-state.json files are grandfathered.
- Quinn a11y tree dependency: browser_snapshot() requires Playwright MCP server running. If MCP unavailable, Quinn falls back to screenshots with WARN. Never block QA on infra failure.
- Negative control cost: Step 5 (revert + re-test) adds ~30-60 seconds per prove cycle. Worth it for bug fixes (46% of validations are non-discriminating without it). Can skip for feature work where there's no "before" state.
- Typed journey generation: brief-assembler generates journeys from ACs with UI type. If AC threshold is too vague for typed assertion (e.g., "looks good"), the journey step gets `type: visual_check` which requires screenshot + human review — it doesn't silently skip.
- Three-layer merge conflicts: if project-config (Layer 2) and harness-generic (Layer 1) conflict, Layer 2 wins. Project knows its own constraints better than the generic template. Issue-specific (Layer 3) can override both — but gate still enforces minimums.
- Parallel work file-overlap detection (SC-69) is advisory at first. False positives (two issues legitimately touching shared utils) should not block. Start as WARN, graduate to FAIL after calibration.
- AI-generated code security: 44% of AI-generated tasks produce known security flaws (Veracode 2026). Rook scan on EVERY build cycle is not optional — it's the only mechanical catch for a 44% defect rate.
- Iterative refinement paradox: asking an agent to "improve" its own code 5+ times increases vulnerabilities 37.6% (IEEE-ISTAS 2025). The harness's circuit breaker (3 iterations max, research required at iteration 2) exists partly for this reason.
- Read-before-write enforcement: the 3:1 ratio (SC-60) is measured from workflow-state.json token counts, not file counts. Agents that read 1 file and change 3 are likely patching symptoms. The ratio is a heuristic — some surgical fixes legitimately have low ratios.
- Rule count caps (SC-138): the 25-rule ceiling is a design target, not a gate FAIL. The data shows compliance degrades at 16+, but the gate-first architecture compensates — the rules most likely to be forgotten are methodology steps, which gates enforce mechanically anyway.
- Brief assembly order (SC-140, SC-145): the U-shaped attention curve is real but varies by model and context length. The ordering is a best-effort optimization, not a guarantee. The primary defense remains mechanical gates, not attention management.
- Always-on 200-word budget (SC-139): measured as prose content in AGENTS.md, excluding table formatting, headers, and code blocks. Tables are information-dense and parse differently than prose rules.
- Activation mode declarations (SC-143): activation modes are metadata for the brief-assembler, not runtime config. The brief-assembler decides what to include based on mode + current context. A template with `mode: agent-decided` is included only when the brief-assembler judges it relevant to the issue type.
- Rule lifecycle 90-day flag (SC-144): the WARN is advisory, not blocking. Some rules are permanent (security constraints, architectural invariants). The flag is a prompt for human review, not an expiration.
- 15 tool-call compliance cliff: this is why the harness uses gates (post-hoc verification) rather than relying on agents to self-enforce rules during long sessions. The cliff validates the architectural decision, not a gap to fix.
- SC-135 and SC-108 unticked (#1217): both claimed a `workflow-state.json` field, and both fields were **deleted** from the schema by #317 as orphan declarations — `proofOfFix` and `quinnJourneyPath` are named in the docblock of `test/state-contract.test.ts` as the two fields "declared and touched by nothing at all". Building either criterion now means re-adding a field that fix removed, which is a design decision this issue does not own. The ticks said the work was done; nothing in `gates/` reads either field. Unticking records the truth and leaves the design question open.
- SC-237 unticked (#1217): it claimed a JSON schema for `.rungate/navigability-score.json`, a file nothing writes — SC-236, the criterion for the command that would produce it, sits directly above and is correctly unticked. `navigability` appears in no file under `lib/`, `scripts/`, `gates/`, `workflows/` or `bin/`; the only occurrence anywhere is a `test.todo` in `test/phase-5.test.ts`, which is the repository recording that it is unbuilt. A schema for a file nothing writes is a plan, and the plan is already stated by SC-236.

## Four ticks withdrawn, and why (#327)

#149 replaced "a test file mentions the id" with "a test file DECLARES the
id", and eight criteria lost their only coverage claim without losing their
tick. That PR deliberately did not untick them: `CHECKED_SC_BASELINE` exists
to stop a suite being made green by unchecking, and doing it silently is the
same defect from the other side. #327 is the ruling that was deferred.

Each of the eight was checked against the tree rather than against the
judgement that produced the tick.

| SC | verdict | what was actually found |
|---|---|---|
| SC-9 | **false — unticked** | `TestSchema` (`lib/rungate-schema.ts:41`) declares `start`, `apiBase`, `command`, `timeout`, `note`. Two of the four fields the criterion names — `test.rebuild` and `test.stop` — do not exist. |
| SC-93 | **not falsifiable — unticked** | "No global dependencies" is undefined, and the tree holds both kinds: `homedir()` in `lib/paths.ts` and `hooks/lib/paths.ts` resolves the `~/.rungate` STATE directory, which is the design, while `scripts/test-clean-env.ts` records a real one — a `$HOME/.claude/hooks/lib/.gate-salt` only this machine has. A criterion that cannot be failed cannot be passed either. Rewriting it to name what counts is its own issue. |
| SC-200 | **false — unticked** | There is no generate-score loop. Searched `lib/`, `gates/`, `scripts/` for the loop, for `generateScore`, and for any iteration-findings count; the only hit anywhere is an unrelated field list in `gates/schema-parity.test.ts`. |
| SC-201 | **false — unticked** | `scripts/extract-constraints.ts` reads a `## Hard Constraints` section but there is no review queue. No `reviewQueue`, `review-queue` or `review_queue` exists in any `.ts`, `.json` or `.jsonl` in the repo, so the half of the criterion that routes auto-extracted rules somewhere has nothing to route them to. |
| SC-123 | **tick is sound** | Its conformity assertion PASSES. The coverage lookup was simply the wrong instrument — `.github/copilot-instructions.md` exists, which is all the criterion asks. |
| SC-202 | **tick is sound** | `lib/rule-provenance.ts` implements it and `test/rule-provenance.test.ts` drives it. The claim was never declared in a position the scanner credits; it is now. |
| SC-501 | **superseded** | Its line already opens `SUPERSEDED by SC-531/SC-534`, exactly as SC-499 and SC-500 do beside it. The convention is deliberate — the line records what the criterion used to say and why it was wrong — and demanding a test for a criterion that explicitly no longer applies would push the spec to delete its own history. Supersession is now a recognised cover state (`lib/sc-cover.ts`). |
| SC-502 | **false — unticked** | "No `execSync.*gh` or `Bun.spawnSync.*gh` in `lib/`, `hooks/`, `gates/`" is a mechanical absence check wearing a `(behavioral)` tag, which exempted it from every check (#328's complaint, instance-wise). It was first classified *satisfied* off a grep — and the grep was wrong. `gates/workflow.test.ts:1570` calls ``execSync(`gh issue view ...`)`` with the command on the NEXT LINE, so a line-oriented search sees nothing and an executed test sees it immediately. The criterion had been ticked over a live violation for its whole life. Migrating that call is the GitHub-API-migration class rather than this one, so it is banked by name in `test/ticked-sc-cover.test.ts` and filed. |

`CHECKED_SC_BASELINE` is 261 and the tree carries 744 ticked criteria after
these four, so the floor is not reached and nothing needed lowering. Recorded
rather than adjusted, because a baseline silently left alone is
indistinguishable from one nobody checked.

### The eight were the visible edge

Measured across the whole tree while classifying them: **748 ticked criteria,
161 with no cover of any kind** — no declaring claim, no passing conformity
assertion, no behavioural exemption, no supersession.

| spec | uncovered |
|---|---|
| `bootstrap-data-flow/success-criteria.md` | 125 (121 after the four above) |
| `INSTRUCTION-COMPLIANCE-SPEC.md` | 12 |
| `AGENTS-MD-TEMPLATE-SPEC.md` | 11 |
| `CONFIG-DRIVEN-TESTING-SPEC.md` | 8 |
| `AGENT-BRIEF-TEMPLATE-SPEC.md` | 2 |
| `DA-COMPLIANCE-SPEC.md` | 2 |
| `HOOK-ARCHITECTURE-SPEC.md` | 1 |

#327's SC-5 asks for a test asserting that count is zero. It cannot be zero
today without writing 157 tests or withdrawing 157 ticks, and a guard written
to pass over a backlog it cannot see is the defect this issue is about. So it
ships as a per-spec ratchet at the measured numbers, ratcheting both ways —
a spec over its number fails, and so does a spec under it, because an entry
that has stopped being a violation is an entry nobody will ever remove.
