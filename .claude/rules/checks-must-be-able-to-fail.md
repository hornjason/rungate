## The rule

Before you trust a check, prove it fails. Break the thing it guards — by hand,
in a scratch edit you throw away — and watch it go red. If it stays green, you
do not have a check, you have a line in a report.

Do this for anything whose job is to catch a problem: a test, a gate, a lint
rule, a ratchet, a CI step.

## Why

This is the single most common defect in this codebase's own tooling — a
count, not a hypothetical. On 2026-10-06 **five of eight issues shipped in
one day** were the same bug: a check that passed because of what it never
looked at. All five: `reference/check-failure-worked-instances.md`, *Why*.

## What makes this hard to notice

A failing check announces itself. A check that cannot fail looks exactly like a
check that is satisfied — and it looks *better* over time, because it never
flakes and never blocks anyone. The quieter it is, the more it is trusted.

Seven shapes to watch for, each invisible to the instrument that finds the
one before it — why, per shape:
`reference/check-failure-worked-instances.md`.

- **Fail-open error handling.** A `catch` that returns "no problems found", or
  a parse failure that defaults to an empty violation list. Anything that can
  throw inside a fail-open guard is a guard bypass; the fail-open is not the
  bug, it is the amplifier.
- **A detector narrower than what it detects.** Text matching that a reformat,
  a line break or a different platform defeats. If the guard's view of the
  input can silently shrink, assert on the view itself.
- **Assertions that hold vacuously.** Comparing two empty collections, matching
  a pattern against text that was stripped out upstream, asserting a value the
  test itself just set.
- **Two deciders that agree.** Two guards answering the same question about the
  same input are behaviourally ONE guard, so no behavioural test can tell them
  apart — and a mutation of either leaves the other holding the case up. Both
  read as covered; one of them is dead and nobody can see which. At N sites
  rather than two, **a behavioural suite catches only the last one to
  regress**, so assert the property across the sites instead of repairing
  them one at a time.
- **A case that goes green under the WRONG fix.** It fails today, for a true
  reason, against exactly what it is pointed at. It also stops failing under
  the cheapest repair somebody reaches for — so it certifies the regression
  it was written to block, at the moment that regression arrives.
- **Green on the exit code, witnessing the wrong mechanism.** Right input,
  wide enough detector, a real assertion — and the run never reached the
  mechanism, because something earlier produced the SAME observable. Two
  mechanisms, one signal, and the case asserts on the signal. **A status code
  is almost never specific to one mechanism**: assert something only the
  intended one can emit.
- **A battery that varies one axis while the defect sits on the other.** Every
  row mutates the guard and every row hands it the same shape of input, so no
  count in the table can come back wrong about an input nobody wrote. The rows
  match their predictions because the prediction and the battery share a blind
  spot. Name what every row holds fixed, then write the row that does not.

### On the fourth, sixth and seventh shapes

Each of the three has a worked record naming the issues, the mutation
counts and the pair or spelling that produced them. The operative half:
**a mutation battery is the only instrument that finds the fourth**, the
sixth is byte-identical to success on the channel you are watching, and
for the seventh **predict the membership, not just the total**. All three,
in full: `reference/check-failure-worked-instances.md`. The fourth at N=3:
`reference/self-referential-tests-worked-instances.md`, *three rounds, three
sites, one rule*.

## Before you report one: a duration is not a mechanism

**Read the `kind`** before inferring a mechanism from a timing, and do not
re-file #1268 — it is already falsified. Both readings:
`reference/check-failure-worked-instances.md`, *a duration is not a
mechanism*.

## In practice

When you add or change a guard, say in the commit or PR **what you broke to
make it fail**. One line is enough: "removing the slice makes it compare the
run against itself, which this now catches." That sentence is cheap to write,
and it is the only evidence that separates a real check from a decorative one.

**And write it as an assertion, not as a comment.** A docblock saying a
property is tested is the reason nobody tests it. Worked instance:
`reference/check-failure-worked-instances.md`, *When the reason nobody
checked is a comment saying it was checked* (#1322).

When a guard has to ship red — a known-violations ratchet — bank progress in
the same commit that earns it, and write down what the number means. A ratchet
nobody can interpret becomes a number nobody lowers.

## For a script whose job is to exit non-zero

A sentence in the PR is evidence a reader has to trust. When the guard is a
script, the break can live in the test instead, and then it is re-checked on
every run.

Route every refusal through **one exported exit-code constant** on a single
line, and have the test build a mutant copy of the source with it set to
`0`. Each negative case runs twice — real script and mutant — asserting the
real one refuses and the mutant does not. The second assertion is the whole
point: the removal of the non-zero exit, performed and observed, so a case
that later passes for an unrelated reason is no longer indistinguishable
from one genuinely caught.

Two properties must be **asserted by the test**, not left as conventions:
the constant appears **exactly once**, so no refusal bypasses the mutation
by inlining `process.exit(1)`; and the script has **no relative imports**,
so the mutant does not die on module resolution — which reads as a refusal
on the merits.

`scripts/rook-review-scope.ts` and `test/rook-review-scope.test.ts` are the
worked example (#129); what was broken to prove it, and the counts, are in
`reference/check-failure-worked-instances.md`.

## For a gate check, where the guard is itself a test

A gate check has no exit code of its own to route through a constant, so the
single site is **one exported function that turns the reading into a list of
violations**, and the mutant is a copy of the whole suite file with that
function short-circuited to `return []`. The copy is spawned —
`bun test <mutant> -t <check name>` — and the real suite is spawned the same
way against the same planted state. Real red, mutant green, one input.

Four things must be **asserted by the test**: the fixture is **executed,
not described**, its failure counted with the harness's own parser; the
check is **observed running** (`ran === 1` first — a `-t` matching nothing
and a mutant that failed to load both report zero failures); the binding
signature appears **exactly once**; and the mutant has **no relative
imports**, or it dies on module resolution and reads as a refusal.

`gates/workflow.test.ts`'s `suiteVerdictViolations` and
`test/suite-binding-mutation.test.ts` are the worked example (#224); the
break and the counts are in `reference/check-failure-worked-instances.md`.

## The worked instances live next door

Every measurement this file used to carry inline — the batteries, the mutation
tables, the named wrong fixes, the counts — is in
`reference/check-failure-worked-instances.md`, in the same order and the same
words. They were moved, not deleted (#1009): they are the only evidence several
of this repository's checks were ever proved able to fail, and deleting them is
the cheapest wrong fix for a file that is too long.

Read them when you are writing the check, not before. They are a record of
measurements already taken; what you need on every turn is above this line.
