/**
 * One GitHub operation, performed over Octokit, for workflow agent steps (#137).
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * `GITHUB-API-MIGRATION-SPEC.md` describes two layers: `mcp__github__*` in
 * agent prompts, Octokit in TypeScript. The prompt layer has never worked in
 * this harness, and the run that found it said so plainly — `ToolSearch` for
 * `mcp__github__add_issue_comment` returned nothing, so `finalize` posted no
 * comment and the run still reported SHIPPED. Two independent reasons, either
 * one sufficient:
 *
 *  1. No role in `.claude/rungate/roles.json` grants `mcp__github__*`, and a
 *     workflow subagent gets the tools its role names.
 *  2. The server `.mcp.json` points at — `@modelcontextprotocol/server-github`
 *     — is deprecated on npm ("Package no longer supported") and does not
 *     connect here, so the tools do not exist for any agent, role or not.
 *
 * The spec's answer to an unavailable MCP server is D-7, an Octokit fallback,
 * with the constraint that it live at the orchestrator level rather than
 * inline in a prompt. It was never built. It also cannot be built where the
 * constraint literally says: `workflows/ship.js` runs in a sandbox with no
 * module loading and no filesystem (#69), so the orchestrator cannot call
 * Octokit itself.
 *
 * So the fallback is a script, invoked from a workflow step the same way
 * `collect-worktree-files.ts` is. The agent runs one command and reports the
 * outcome; the decision of what to send is this script's, in a process that
 * can import `lib/github.ts`. No second copy of the API logic exists to drift.
 *
 * ## Contract
 *
 * One JSON object on stdout, diagnostics on stderr, exit 0 on success and 1 on
 * failure. Callers that need the result parse stdout; callers that only need
 * "did it work" read the exit code. Every failure prints a reason — this
 * replaced a path whose failure mode was silence.
 *
 * Bodies come from a file rather than an argument. A PR body contains
 * newlines, backticks and quotes, and an agent assembling that into a shell
 * argument is how injection and truncation both happen.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   bun scripts/github-op.ts pr-upsert    --repo o/n --head B --base main --title T [--body-file F]
 *   bun scripts/github-op.ts comment      --repo o/n --issue N (--body-file F | --body S)
 *   bun scripts/github-op.ts issue-update --repo o/n --issue N [--state closed] [--body-file F]
 *   bun scripts/github-op.ts issue-label  --repo o/n --issue N --labels a,b
 *   bun scripts/github-op.ts issue-get    --repo o/n --issue N
 *   bun scripts/github-op.ts issue-create --repo o/n --title T [--body-file F] [--labels a,b]
 *   bun scripts/github-op.ts ci-status    --repo o/n --sha SHA [--timeout-ms N] [--interval-ms N]

/**
 * Take this run's filing allowance for one tool-path issue (#1677, SC-2613).
 *
 * ## What this closes
 *
 * `lib/issue-create-override.ts` meters filing by parsing a bash command, so
 * it sees `gh issue create` and nothing else. `issue-create` here is Octokit:
 * no command exists, nothing parses, and before this the run filed as many
 * issues as it liked while the ledger recorded none of them. The cap then
 * measured one of the two doors and reported that as the run's total.
 *
 * ## It reserves against the SAME ledger, and decides nothing itself
 *
 * `reserveAllowance` appends an intent and reads its own position back, and
 * appends to one file are serialised by the filesystem — so the CLI path and
 * this path take positions in one total order rather than keeping two
 * counts that drift. Nothing about the cap is re-decided here: the cap comes
 * from `filingsPerRunFor`, the run from `runIdFor`, the ordering from the
 * ledger. A second decider over the same question would be behaviourally one
 * decider with a dead half (`.claude/rules/checks-must-be-able-to-fail.md`,
 * the fourth shape).
 *
 * ## Every failure refuses
 *
 * An unreadable run, an unappendable ledger, a ledger that cannot be read
 * back: each is a failure to establish or update the cap's state, which is
 * indistinguishable from an attempt to switch the cap off. `createIssue`
 * turns a throw into a refusal, so throwing here IS the refusal.
 *
 * The planned-filing exemption is deliberately **not** reimplemented. This
 * path has no finding body to match a plan title against — it has a title
 * and nothing else — and a second, weaker spelling of an exemption is how
 * the cap acquires a third door. A planned filing goes through the CLI
 * path, where `plannedFiling` reads `origin/main`.
