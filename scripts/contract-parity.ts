/**
 * One mechanical comparison over the class of defect this harness keeps
 * shipping: **a producer and a consumer that must agree, with nothing
 * comparing them** (#626).
 *
 * Twelve defects in one session were that shape. Each was detectable in
 * seconds by reading two files; each cost between a ten-minute hand re-measure
 * and a seventy-minute run. The table is on the issue; the six categories
 * below are drawn from it rather than invented:
 *
 * | Category | The producer | The consumer | The row it comes from |
 * |---|---|---|---|
 * | `command-parity` | `.claude/rungate/config.json` | `AGENTS.md`, `ci.yml`, the scaffold | #621 |
 * | `toolchain-parity` | `.bun-version` / `ci.bunVersion` | every workflow's `setup-bun`, the running runtime | #622, #622b, #622c |
 * | `transport-parity` | the evidence-command transport | `workflows/ship.js`'s inlined copy and its call sites | #614, #600 |
 * | `probe-honesty` | an external tool's absence | a check reading one boolean | #597 |
 * | `field-reachability` | whatever writes the shared state | every gate that reads it | #530, #611 |
 * | `write-accountability` | code that writes a tracked file | git, and the managed-file table | #624 |
 *
 * ## Three properties, and none of them is the verdict
 *
 * **1. A comparison that could not be performed is UNMEASURED, never PASS.**
 * A check that reads N positions and compares what it found is satisfied by
 * finding nothing in all N — zero strings are trivially all equal. That is the
 * third shape in `.claude/rules/checks-must-be-able-to-fail.md` and the way
 * this check is most likely to die, because most of what it reads is
 * generated: a template edit moves a table row, a regex stops matching, and
 * the category goes quiet rather than red. So every unreadable position is
 * recorded, with WHICH of the three ways it was unreadable — an absent file,
 * an unparseable one, and a declared source that cannot be resolved stay three
 * things. `.claude/rules/config-access.md`: a corrupt config is never a
 * missing config.
 *
 * **2. Every verdict carries its own coverage.** `36/426` and `426/426` are
 * the same PASS today and no reader can tell them apart from the output —
 * that is #492, recorded in the rules file as the reporting fix a scan owes
 * its reader. Each category here reports sites examined over sites visible,
 * so a category that quietly stopped reading four of its six positions says so
 * while still passing.
 *
 * **3. The check is against the contract, not against an artefact.** #530 is
 * the worked example: a permissive store answers yes to every question of the
 * form "is this here", because you put it there. `field-reachability` walks
 * the Zod shape rather than the JSON, and `toolchain-parity` reads what the
 * generator would EMIT rather than only the checked-in copies — which is
 * #622c, where a fix that edited only the committed workflows would have left
 * every scaffolded consumer unpinned.
 *
 * ## What this is not
 *
 * Not a preflight. Two unrelated things in this repository already wear that
 * name — `preflightResults` in `workflows/ship.js` is SSH host reachability,
 * and `lib/release-preflight.ts` is npm release verification — and a third
 * meaning would be its own parity defect.
 *
 * ## Usage
 *
 *   bun scripts/contract-parity.ts [--root <dir>] [--category <name>] [--json]
 *
 * Exits `REFUSE_EXIT` when any category reports a violation or could not be
 * measured. UNMEASURED is not a pass: `0`, `{}`, `null` and silence are all
 * indistinguishable from success, which is the whole subject of this file.
 *
 * ## Where the comparisons live
 *
 * `testCommandAgreement` and the state-contract walk were written as part of
 * `test/test-command-agreement.test.ts` (#621) and `test/state-contract.test.ts`
 * (#317). They are HERE now and those two files import them, so there is one
 * binding per comparison rather than one in a test and a second one in this
 * script — which would be this issue's own defect, committed by the thing
 * built to detect it.

// evaluates the marked block of the inspected tree's `workflows/ship.js`
// through `new Function` and spawns one `bun -e`. `--root` chooses that tree,

//
// The first draft of this file wrote that limit down as prose — "first-party
// by assumption, do not point it at a tree you would not run `bun test` in" —
// and a security review was right to flag it. A stated assumption nothing
// executes is this repository's own named defect, and writing it two lines
// above the `new Function` that ignores it is that defect at its purest.
//
// So it is a refusal now. `transportIsFirstParty` is the single binding that
// decides, and a foreign root reports UNMEASURED — never PASS, which is the
// distinction AC-4 exists for. Nothing is lost by this: AC-5 drives its
// `git archive` export through `commandParity`, which only reads.
//
// `test/evidence-command-roundtrip.test.ts` has extracted and executed the
// same block since #614, and still does. The difference is that a test has no
// `--root`: it can only ever mean this tree.

 *
 * Worth naming because it is NOT the same failure in one respect: both of
