/**
 * The success criteria a source file CLAIMS to cover (#149).
 *
 * The old rule was "the file mentions the id". Tests of the spec tooling embed
 * spec lines and SC records as INPUT — they assert how an SC is parsed,
 * flipped or scanned, and nothing about the criterion the id names — so a
 * mention was never evidence of coverage. #148 removed the two worst shapes by
 * name with a pair of regexes; this replaces the convention, which is what
 * that fix deferred here.
 *
 * ## The rule
 *
 * One question, not a list of shapes: **is the id the whole of what was
 * written, or is it embedded in something else?**
 *
 *   claim   a mention in a comment, or in a describe/test/it title
 *   data    everything else — any id inside a string literal
 *
 * A list of forbidden shapes is a second place to forget, and forgetting there
 * reads as the mention being a claim, which is the failure direction that
 * flatters us. An allowlist of two declaring positions cannot fail that way:
 * a shape nobody thought of is not credited.
 *
 * ## Why not "a complete string literal also counts"
 *
 * Because it cannot be made safe, and the attempt is worth recording. A
 * criterion registry is real coverage:
 *
 *     const EXPECTED_REREVIEW_SCS = ["SC-621", "SC-622", …];   // coverage
 *
 * but so is this, and it is a test PARAMETER naming the criterion a bug was
 * about:
 *
 *     const SHORTEST_ID = "SC-1";                               // not coverage
 *     const scs = [{ id: "SC-1", done: true }];                 // not coverage
 *     findTestFilesForSCs(new Set(["SC-9", "SC-92"]), dir);     // not coverage
 *
 * All four are bare ids in quotes. Nothing syntactic separates them — not
 * `id:`, not array-vs-scalar, not the variable's name. A rule that credited
 * them would certify criteria nobody tested, and that is the direction this
 * project's own `.claude/rules/checks-must-be-able-to-fail.md` says never to
 * fail in.
 *
 * So a registry declares itself with a comment. That costs one line, it is
 * already the convention most files follow, and unlike an inference it cannot
 * be wrong in the flattering direction.
 *
 * ## Why a bare literal counts
 *
 * #149's body proposed titles and comments only. Measured against the tree,
 * that demotes `const EXPECTED_REREVIEW_SCS = ["SC-621", …]` in
 * test/harness-standard-security.test.ts — a criterion registry driving a
 * per-criterion loop, which .claude/rules/checks-must-be-able-to-fail.md holds
 * up as the worked example for that spec. It is a BETTER coverage mechanism
 * than a hand-written title because the ids cannot drift from the assertions,
 * and a rule that dropped it would push authors toward the weaker pattern.
 *
 * ## Why it is built on stripJsComments rather than on lines
 *
 * The three categories have to be told apart at the right level, and a
 * line-oriented detector cannot do it. `fixtureTestDir("x", "// covers SC-92")`
 * contains a comment that is STRING DATA: a rule asking "does this line start
 * with //" is fooled by its own test fixture. stripJsComments is an
 * offset-preserving scanner over exactly these contexts, so two views of the
 * same source — comments blanked, and comments plus literal CONTENTS blanked —
 * classify every character by subtraction, with no second lexer to drift.

 * the GitHub API migration spec. The narrow `SC-\d+` pattern was the only
 * thing hiding it, which is why #330 said widening the regex without fixing
 * scoping makes the measurement worse.
 *
 * An id whose bare mention does not identify a criterion is credited only
 * when the text around it names the spec. That is the whole of the fix for
 * three issues:
 *
 * - `SC-A1` in `ceremony-overrides.test.ts` names no spec, and no spec
 *   declares those criteria — they are an issue's own. Not credited.
 * - `SC-6` in `context-preload-parity.test.ts` is #71's sixth criterion, not
 *   `bootstrap-data-flow`'s. Not credited.
 * - `SC-640` in `harness-standard-security.test.ts` is unique in the
 *   registry, so it needs no qualifier and keeps its credit.
 *
 * ## Why a qualified COMMENT is still not enough
 *
 * The first version of this accepted any mention with the spec's name
 * nearby, and gained two credits it should not have. `behavioral-sc-ratchet
 * .test.ts` opens with prose about a past bug:
 *
 *     used `SC-[0-9]+` and SC ids are not always numeric — `SC-A1` and `SC-A2`
 *     in GITHUB-API-MIGRATION-SPEC.md were missed.
 *
 * Every ingredient of a qualified claim, and it is a citation. A window says
 * WHICH criterion a mention means; it cannot say WHETHER the mention is a
 * claim, and #149 already decided that a bare comment counts as one — which
 * is fine for an id only this file would write and wrong for an id prose
 * cites constantly.
 *
 * So an ambiguous id must be claimed from a `describe`/`test`/`it` title AND
 * name its spec. That is the strongest position the convention has, it is
 * where a real anti-criterion test would put it anyway, and prose cannot
 * reach it by accident. The cost is that six anti-criteria stay uncredited
 * until someone writes such a title — under-crediting, which is the
 * direction this is allowed to fail in.

/**
 * Ids whose only declaring position in the test tree is a title that never

 *
 * An id that ALSO has a running title anywhere is not here: the question is
 * whether anything can measure it, not whether a todo exists. That
 * distinction is the whole report — otherwise every criterion with a todo
 * beside a real test would be listed as unmeasured and the list would be
 * ignored within a week.
 *
 * ## A declaring comment used to count as measurement, and it does not (#810)
 *
 * It was the natural reading and it is wrong in one direction only, which is
 * why nobody noticed: a comment is where this project DECLARES coverage, so a
 * declaring comment plus a todo read as "somebody wrote the test and left a
 * stale todo beside it". The population it actually describes is the
 * opposite — a file about something else quoting the criterion as fixture
 * input, in a docstring, on its own line, which is a declaring form.
 *
 * Measured on this tree at the time of #810: **five** ids were in that state
 * and **zero** of them had a running title. Four were `SC-1930`, `SC-1940`,
 * `SC-1943` and `SC-1944`, cited by `audit-specs-fallback-scope.test.ts` and
 * `audit-specs-rewrite-fidelity.test.ts` — both tests of the spec-rewriting
 * tool, neither a test of a rule-lifecycle criterion. `sync-sc-status.ts`
 * ticked all four, and the tick then broke the citing file's own premise,
 * which asserts the spec still reads `- [ ] SC-1940: …`.
 *
 * So the comparison this makes is between a statement about EXECUTION and a
 * statement about intent. A comment is neither, and crediting it here made
 * `SC-1957`'s invariant — *"an id is reported unmeasured AND credited by a
 * test claim"* — true by construction: an id with a declaring comment could
 * not enter this report, so the two readings could not disagree. Narrowing
 * `measured` is what gives that case something to see.
