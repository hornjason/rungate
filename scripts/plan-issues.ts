/**
 * Apply an approved repair plan to the tracker (#1647).
 *
 * `--repair <plan.md>` reads a table somebody reviewed — today
 * `docs/adr/ADR-005-backlog-criterion-repair.md` — and does the two things
 * `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/spec-work.yml` says in its own footer that a GitHub
 * issue form cannot do: name the criteria an issue serves in a shape every
 * reader can find, and move an issue out of a milestone it does not belong in.
 *
 * ## It reports by default and writes only when told
 *
 * No `--write`, no mutation.
 *
 * ## A demotion removes that issue's edges, and ONLY that issue's
 *
 * `plan-deps` never removes an edge — the rule protects the two hand-authored
 * within-phase dependencies no derivation can reproduce. But an issue leaving
 * its phase orphans every edge it had: on 2026-10-29 #1395 and #1643 each
 * carried 3 blockers and BLOCKED all six Phase 6 issues, so demoting them
 * without removing those 18 edges would leave Phase 6 waiting forever on work
 * that is no longer in the plan — the order silently wrong in the direction
 * nothing can see.
 *
 * A general prune cannot fix that, because nothing distinguishes a
 * hand-authored edge from an orphaned one by inspection. So the removal is
 * **scoped to the demotion that causes it**: this removes the edges of the
 * issues it is itself demoting, and touches no others. The cause and the
 * cleanup are one action.

  --repair     an approved repair plan. A table of

               where Repair is (a) annotate or (b) demote.
  --decompose  a decomposition plan — step 4 of ADR-003. A table of
               | Criterion | Outcome | Files | Milestone | Blocked by |
               where one row is one issue proving one criterion.
  --repo       owner/name. Defaults to $GITHUB_REPOSITORY.
  --write      apply it. Without this nothing is mutated.
  --json       the whole reading.

rungate plan-issues --accepted-since <commit> [--project-root <dir>]

  Print each docs/adr/*.md that is accepted now and was not at <commit>, and
