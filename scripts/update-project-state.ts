 * dropped the improvement out of `OPEN_WITHOUT_ISSUE` in
 * `test/stage-ladder.test.ts` — a ratchet quietly satisfied by malformed
 * data.
 *
 * **Delegated, not re-implemented.** A `typeof im.issue === "number" &&
 * Number.isInteger(...)` guard in the renderer would answer a question
 * `stageLadderViolations` already answers, and a mutation of either would
 * leave the other holding every case up — `.claude/rules/
