/**
 * Print the census tests a change can trip — the ones the import graph cannot
 * reach (#990).
 *
 * `.claude/rules/self-referential-tests.md` carries a "What to run before you
 * push" list. It is prose, and prose routes what its author remembered. #990
 * is the measured cost: its `specs/` row names the pair that an *edit* to a
 * spec trips, and nothing names the three that a *tick* trips. A criterion
 * went `- [ ]` -> `- [x]`, every targeted suite was green locally, and CI went
 * red in `test/sc-binding-split.test.ts` — a file the change does not touch.
 *
 * ## Why this is not `scripts/select-affected-tests.ts`
 *
 * That script selects by import graph. A census test imports none of the
 * things that move it: `test/sc-binding-split.test.ts` walks `specs/`, it does
 * not import any spec. Measured on this tree at the time of writing, with
 * `specs/HARNESS-STANDARD.md` as the only changed file, `affectedTests`
 * returns MEASURED with 112 of its files selected and:
 *
 *   test/ticked-sc-cover.test.ts        selected, as a sweep
 *   test/sc-binding-split.test.ts       MISSING
 *   test/behavioral-sc-ratchet.test.ts  MISSING
 *
 * So the gap #990 reports in the prose list is also in the automated selector,
 * and for a reason the selector cannot fix: a census test's input is the shape
 * of the tree, which no edge expresses. The two are complements. This one
 * routes by what the diff DID; that one routes by what the diff IMPORTS.
 *
 * ## Why the triggers read the diff, not just the path list
 *
 * An edit to a spec and a tick inside one are the same path and different
 * events, with different blast radii. A router that sees only
 * `git diff --name-only` is definitionally unable to tell them apart, which is
 * the whole of #990. So a change here carries its added and removed lines.
 *
 * ## What this does NOT do
 *
 * It does not enforce. It prints a command; running it is still a decision,
 * and an agent that reads neither the rule nor this script is unaffected by
 * both. Refusing a push whose census tests were not in the run's measured set
 * needs a notion of "what this session ran" that does not exist here.

 * it compares `CENSUS_TRIGGERS` to the rendered prose in
 * `.claude/rules/self-referential-tests.md` in both directions, and a census

 *
 * So the population has to come from the tree. The observable property is the
 * one the issue names: **a suite whose input is the repository tree rather
 * than a fixture**. Concretely, it ENUMERATES a directory resolved from its
 * own repo-root binding — `readdirSync(join(REPO, "test"))` — because that is
 * what makes the set of files an input, and a set of files is the one input
 * no import edge expresses and no diff contains.
 *
 * Reading a single NAMED file from the root is deliberately not enough. Most
 * suites in `test/` do that, the population would be the whole directory, and

 * Why the masking above is `stripJsComments`'s and not this file's.
 *
 * The self-reference trap arrives here in the one spelling a comment stripper

 * own fixtures as single-quoted STRINGS, and read as code they put the test
 * file into the population it derives. Measured — it appeared in its own
 * unrouted list on the first run.
 *
 * The first cut answered that with a local mask, and the local mask was
 * wrong twice, each time in the quiet direction:
 *
 *   - It read `/["']/` as a string opener, so the `"` inside the PATTERN
 *     opened a string that never closed and every enumeration below it in
 *     the file became quoted text. That dropped `scaffold-generators` and
 *     `ai-review-surface-census`; the stale-exclusion guard reported it.
 *   - Repaired with a single-previous-CHARACTER regex heuristic, it then
 *     read `return /["']/` as division — prev is `n` — and reintroduced the
 *     same swallow behind a keyword. Found by the AI review on PR #1556.
 *     The docblock defending that heuristic claimed erring toward division
 *     "can only ADD files to the population". It cannot: a pattern with
 *     unbalanced quotes REMOVES them, and `["']` is exactly that.
 *
 * `lib/strip-js-comments.ts` already holds this decision, keyword-aware,
 * with `REGEX_ALLOWED_AFTER_WORD` put there by #905 for this exact defect.
 * A second heuristic here that agrees with it today is two deciders, so no
 * behavioural case can tell them apart and a mutation of either leaves the
 * other holding the case up. `blankLiterals` is the one binding; there is
 * deliberately nothing local left to widen.
