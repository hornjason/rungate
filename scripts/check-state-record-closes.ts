/**
 * Which issues will GitHub close when this session record becomes a PR? (#590)
 *
 * PR #588's squash commit carried `Filed and not fixed: #586`, rendered from
 * `project-state.json`'s session-49 summary. GitHub's closing-keyword parser
 * sees `fixed: #586`; it has no concept of the `not` in front of it. #586
 * closed one second after the merge with `stateReason: COMPLETED`, having
 * shipped nothing.
 *
 * "Filed and not fixed" is the phrase this project uses for deliberately
 * deferred work, so the exposure is not a one-off typo: **the more honest the
 * session record, the more issues it wrongly closes.** It has happened twice
 * already — `lib/issue-closure-audit.ts` records "not yet fixed: #178"
 * auto-closing #178 on 2026-10-08, and says in the same breath that it
 * deliberately does not catch it, because an auto-close carries a `commit_id`
 * and that audit asks about attribution.
 *
 * So the question here is the one neither of them asks: before the PR is
 * opened, does the set of issues GitHub would close from its title, body and
 * commit message equal the set the record SAYS it closed?
 *
 * Both directions are refusals, and they are two DIFFERENT questions asked of
 * two different things (#605):
 *
 *   - **keyword -> undeclared.** A closing keyword in the title, body or
 *     commit message that the record never declared is #586 happening again.
 *     Unchanged since #590; this is the half that has earned its place twice.
 *   - **declared -> not closed.** An id in `issues_closed` that is not CLOSED
 *     on GitHub is a record that reads done over an issue that is not.
 *
 * ## Why the second question is no longer asked of the text (#605)
 *
 * It used to be "a declared close with no keyword behind it". That reads
 * `issues_closed` as *what this PR will close*, and it is not: it is *what
 * the session closed*, across days of work and many PRs, almost all of them
 * merged before the state PR exists. Session 50 declared #274, #585, #586 and
 * #590 — four issues closed by four of their own PRs — and the check refused
 * all four, correctly given its model and false about the world.
 *
 * The way to make it stop was to write four no-op closing keywords into the
 * PR body, and then — purer and worse — into `session.summary`, a position
 * GitHub never parses. Four records in a row did it. That is satisfying the
 * proxy instead of the property, and the proxy it satisfies is **writing
 * closing keywords into narrative prose**, which is the exact defect #590 was
 * filed over. The check was manufacturing its own failure mode.
 *
 * So the declared side asks GitHub. A record declaring an id that is already
 * CLOSED passes with no keyword anywhere, and the incentive disappears.
 *
 * ## An unreachable GitHub is UNMEASURED, and UNMEASURED is not clean
 *
 * The declared side needs a reading this file cannot take locally, so it has
 * a third state. `0`, `{}`, `null` and `SKIP` are indistinguishable from
 * success; UNMEASURED is not. A declared id with no reading behind it refuses
 * and says so by name — see `.claude/rules/config-access.md`.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   bun scripts/check-state-record-closes.ts --state project-state.json \
 *       [--title "<pr title>"] [--body-file <f>] [--message-file <f>] \
 *       [--repo owner/name] [--issue-states github|<file.json>]
 *
 * `--issue-states github` asks the GitHub REST API (needs `--repo`, and
 * `GITHUB_TOKEN`/`GH_TOKEN` for a private repository). `--issue-states <file>`
 * reads a JSON object mapping issue number to `OPEN` or `CLOSED`, which is how
 * the suite drives the declared side without a network. With neither, there is
 * no reading, and every declared id is UNMEASURED.
 *
 * Exits 0 and prints its own coverage when both questions are clean; exits
 * STATE_CLOSES_REFUSE_EXIT and names what it found when they are not.
 *
 * ## Why this is not called from scripts/update-project-state.ts
 *
 * That was the obvious home for it, and it is the wrong one. The renderer's
 * only caller is `.git/hooks/pre-commit`, which invokes it as
 * `bun scripts/update-project-state.ts 2>/dev/null || true` — stderr
 * discarded, exit code discarded. A refusal wired in there would be silent,
 * and its only observable effect would be that PROJECT-STATE.md quietly
 * stopped being re-rendered. That is a fail-open amplifier rather than a
 * guard: the file whose entire purpose is telling the next session where the
 * project is would go stale, and nothing would say so.
 *
 * So the comparison is executed from the suite instead —
 * `test/closing-keywords.test.ts` runs it over the real `project-state.json`
 * on every run, with the current exposure banked by number — and from here,
 * before a state PR is opened. Measured on this tree, the live session-49
 * record reports exactly one finding, #586, which is the defect this issue
 * is about and which only the DA can repair (`project-state.json` is
 * DA-owned, #296).
 *
 * TWO PROPERTIES THIS FILE MUST KEEP, both asserted by
 * test/state-record-closes-mutation.test.ts (see
 * .claude/rules/checks-must-be-able-to-fail.md):
 *
 *   1. Every refusal exits through STATE_CLOSES_REFUSE_EXIT, declared exactly
 *      once. The test builds a mutant copy with that constant set to 0 and
 *      runs every negative case twice — real refuses, mutant does not. An
 *      exit written with a literal code would slip past the mutation, and the
 *      case guarding it would become indistinguishable from one passing by
 *      accident.
 *   2. No relative imports. The mutant runs from a temp directory, and a
 *      relative import of anything under lib/ would make it die on module
 *      resolution — a non-zero exit that reads as the mutation having been
 *      rejected on the merits.
 *
 * Both guards look at the whole file, prose included, for the reason
 * scripts/rook-review-scope.ts gives: a detector that first strips comments
 * is a detector whose view of the input can silently shrink.

/**
 * The credential, resolved the way `resolveGitHubToken` in `lib/github.ts`
 * resolves it — and deliberately NOT by importing it.
 *
 * This file must have no relative imports. `test/state-record-closes-mutation.test.ts`
 * asserts that, because its mutants are copied to a temp directory and run
 * there: a `from "../lib/…"` makes every mutant die on module resolution,
 * which is a non-zero exit that reads as a rejected mutation. So the one
 * rule this repository has about credentials — one decider — cannot be
 * satisfied here by calling it.
 *
 * What is done instead is the repository's documented alternative for an
 * import-free file: the value is bound by an AGREEMENT ASSERTION. The grid
 * in `test/token-host-allowlist.test.ts` runs both implementations over the
 * same envs and fails on any input where they differ, so a change to either
 * one is red until the other follows.
 *
 * Two things are copied from it on purpose and both were defects here
 * before #1755 reviewed this file:
 *
 *   - BOTH names, `GH_TOKEN` second. `gh auth login` sets `GH_TOKEN` and
 *     nothing sets `GITHUB_TOKEN` on this machine (#139/#140).
 *   - `.trim()`. `GH_TOKEN=$(cat token)` carries a trailing newline, and a
 *     token sent with one 401s with nothing naming the whitespace.
 *
 * The names are read out of an ARRAY rather than written inline, which is
 * also what keeps the credential census in that file honest: it forbids
 * either name spelled as a property read off an environment record, and the
 * correct form is the one that does not look like the defect.
 *
 * This sentence is deliberately not spelling the forbidden form out. The
 * first draft did, and the census flagged THIS DOCBLOCK — a detector that
 * refuses its own documentation is one somebody relaxes rather than obeys,
 * which is the note the census has carried since it was written and which I
 * then walked straight into.
