 * fourth shape in `.claude/rules/checks-must-be-able-to-fail.md` pointing the
 * wrong way: two deciders, disagreeing, with the reporter the one people read.
 * It was narrow in two directions at once.
 *
 * - **`SC-\w+` cannot see a `CRC-` id.** `TRACKED_ID_PREFIXES` has held two
 *   namespaces since #1313. `specs/CODE-REVIEW-CONVERGENCE-SPEC.md` declares
 *   56 criteria and is marked `compliance: strict`, and this reported
 *   `total 0` for it. That is worse than crashing: silence is visibly broken,
 *   `0` reads as "nothing to do" and stops anyone looking.
 * - **The `- [ ] ` literal cannot see a TICKED criterion**, in any namespace.
 *   So the `SC-` side had been under-reporting for its whole life and nobody
 *   noticed, because the number it printed was plausible. Measured on this
 *   tree: **66 reported against 1,669 declared.** It was showing 4% of the
 *   corpus.
 *
 * `parseScDeclarations` is the one owner, so this reporter, the status
 * flipper, the drift gate and the collision detectors now agree about what a
 * criterion is by construction rather than by four regexes happening to match.

 *
 * Reporting a criterion costs a row in a table. Rewriting one edits a spec,
 * and #1286 is open about `--fix` damaging a file it should not have touched.
 * Different decisions, different risk, so the reporter widened and the writer
 * did not. Each clause subtracts a population this change would otherwise
 * have handed the rewriter as a side effect:
 *
 * | clause | what it holds back, measured on this tree |
 * |---|---|
 * | `!checked` | 1,443 ticked criteria — finished work |
 * | `SC-` prefix | 55 unmatched `CRC-` criteria, in a spec being bound concurrently |
 * | top-level | 91 unmatched criteria in a split spec under `specs/` |
 *
 * All three live here rather than being enforced upstream, because a clause
 * split across two sites is two deciders for one question: mutate either and
 * the other holds the case up.
 *
 * This is a SCOPE, not a second opinion about what a criterion is —
 * `extractSCs` remains the only thing that decides that. Deleting a clause is
 * a deliberate one-line widening whenever somebody wants it, and
 * `test/audit-specs-blindness.test.ts` AB-4 measures that the set it selects
