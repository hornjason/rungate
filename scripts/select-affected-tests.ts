/**
 * Print the test files a run needs, or print nothing and mean "run everything".
 *
 * The subprocess half of #676. `workflows/ship.js` cannot import (#69), so
 * the reading crosses the boundary the way `scripts/resolve-config.ts` and
 * `phase2AcsCommand` already do: this script writes the whole reading into
 * the run's work directory, and the generated command consumes what it
 * prints. There is one selection implementation and this is its only caller.
 *
 * **Printing nothing is the safe answer, and it is load-bearing.** The
 * generated command is `<testCommand> $(this script)`, so empty output runs
 * the full suite — the same thing the run did before #676. Every path that
 * cannot establish a trustworthy selection takes it:
 *
 *   - the graph returned UNMEASURED (a non-module changed, no tests found,
 *     nothing changed)
 *   - the graph returned MEASURED but selected nothing. Running zero tests
 *     would leave the recorder with no summary to read, which is #469, and
 *     "no test is affected" is not a claim worth betting a merge on when the
 *     cost of being wrong is a regression and the cost of being right is one
 *     suite that will essentially never run
 *   - git could not name the changed files
 *
 * All three are recorded in the artefact by name. A run that selected a
 * subset and a run that fell back must never be byte-identical in the
 * record — that is the whole reporting-position defect this repo keeps
 * finding, and here it would hide a saving that silently became a skip.
 *
 * ## Two routers, because one question has two shapes (#1004)
 *
 * `affectedTests` routes by what a change IMPORTS. A census test imports
 * none of the things that move it — it walks a directory, and the shape of
 * the tree is not an edge. Measured on this repository with one spec file
 * changed and nothing else, the graph alone returns MEASURED with 114 of 388
 * files, reaches `ticked-sc-cover` only because it happens to trip a sweep
 * pattern, and misses `sc-binding-split` and `behavioral-sc-ratchet`
 * outright. MEASURED means no fallback, so those two were simply not run.
 *
 * `censusTestsFor` routes by what a change DID — a tick is not an edit, and
 * the two are the same path. Its result is UNIONED into a SELECTED
 * selection here, and nowhere else, so there is still one decider per
 * question and one place that answers "what does this run execute".
 *
 * Three properties of the union are deliberate:
 *
 *   - **FULL_SUITE is left alone.** A fallback already runs everything; a
 *     census union on top of it would be a no-op that made the artefact
 *     look like a selection.
 *   - **`graphTests` and `censusTests` are recorded separately**, for the
 *     same reason `fellBackBecause` exists. A run that took a subset and a
 *     run that took a subset plus three census files are different events,
 *     and an artefact that cannot tell them apart cannot be used to find
 *     out which one happened.
 *   - **A routed census test absent from the tree is recorded, not
 *     appended.** The census table names this repository's own paths, and
 *     this script also runs in scaffolded projects that have none of them.
 *     Handing `bun test` a path that matches nothing is a run whose
 *     denominator nobody can explain, so absence goes to `censusAbsent`
 *     where a reader can see it. In this repository absence is red
 *     independently — `test/census-routing.test.ts` asserts every routed
 *     path exists — so the filter cannot quietly become the thing that
 *     hides a rename.
 *
 * ## Three routers, because the question has a third shape (#1054)
 *
 * `textDependents` routes by what a change's TEXT IS READ BY. A file that
 * lifts a marker-delimited region out of `workflows/ship.js` and executes it
 * imports nothing and walks nothing; it names an anchor. Measured on PR
 * #1034's first commit, the graph's basename rule did reach all five files
 * that went red — inside a selection of 226 of 538, with no statement of
 * why any of them was there. The text router names 13 readers for the same
 * change, each with the anchor and the `ship.js` line span that put it
 * there, and `scripts/text-dependents.ts` prints that before a push.
 *
 * Its union here is ADDITIVE and narrow, which is sound for the opposite
 * reason the graph's over-selection is: this contributor can only add to a
 * selection two other routers already made, so being too tight costs
 * nothing the graph was not already covering, while being too loose costs
 * the saving the whole mechanism exists for. An UNMEASURED reading from it
 * still falls the run back to the full suite — "could not look" is not
 * "found nothing", and that distinction is the reason this file exists.
 *
 * All three routers now read ONE git invocation, `changesFor`. They previously
 * asked git different questions — names only here, added and removed lines
 * there — and a name list is definitionally unable to tell a tick from an
 * edit, which is the whole of #990.
