/**
 * Post an AI review's findings onto the pull request's diff (#1612).
 *
 * Usage:
 *   bunx rungate ai-review-threads <findings.json> --repo owner/name --pr 12 --commit <sha>
 *   bun bin/rungate.ts ai-review-threads <path> --repo owner/name --pr 12 --commit <sha>
 *
 * Optional: `--changed-files <path>` — the pull request's changed-path list,
 * one per line. Supplying it is what lets a finding naming a file this pull
 * request does not touch be held back rather than sent and refused.
 *
 * ## Why this is a separate command from `ai-review-findings`
 *
 * The adjudicator EXITS NON-ZERO on a blocking finding. That is its whole
 * contract. A poster sharing that entry point would inherit the refusal and
 * could never run on the review it most needs to run on — the one that found
 * something. So the reading is taken twice, by the same reader, in two
 * processes with two different jobs.
 *
 * The exit code is `lib/ai-review-threads.ts`'s, routed through
 * `AI_REVIEW_THREADS_REFUSAL`, for the reason `scripts/ai-review-findings.ts`
 * gives at length: a `process.exit(1)` written here would be a second
 * non-zero exit that a mutation of the constant cannot reach.
 *
 * ## It does not adjudicate, and must not
 *
 * A blocking finding is the adjudicator's to refuse. If this file also
 * refused, the two would be a pair of deciders that always agree — the
 * fourth shape in `.claude/rules/checks-must-be-able-to-fail.md` — and no
 * behavioural test could tell which of them was holding the gate up.
